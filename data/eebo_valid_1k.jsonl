Indeed Oppoſitions are good Aſpects for fair Fighting, but ſtark nought for foul Plotting. Good Men will alſo be vigilant in foreſeeing thoſe evils, and Fiſhing out thei diſmal effects.\nFrom the Poſition of Mars in the 10th in Leo, and near co\n•\n Leonis, we may expect to hear of many great Spirits rampant, Grandees vexed with imperious Subjects, and many ſuch poor Subjects, as much perplexed with the ſeverity of their Princes; grievous complaints of Hoſtilities, Impoſitions, and hard Uſage; much Thunder in the Air, alſo very bold and thundering expreſſions among Men.\nFrom the Poſition of Saturn in the 4th in Aquary, we may look for deep and dark Contrivances againſt Governours, ſtrong and ſturdy means uſed to undermine Governments, the ruine and downfal of Buildings, Earthquakes and cold Blaſts, doing much miſchief to Corn in the Ground when there are great porſpects of a good Crop; much damage to Springs, Fountains, asd Water-courſes, Conduits and Decoys.\nNew for my threefold Repitition of the ſignification of Saturn and Mars\nin this ſolar Eclipſe, I do not hold my ſelf guilty of any needleſs Totoligy; for they are neceſſarily ſo to be conſidered; firſt as they are the Ruler of the Eclipſe, ſecondly as they are in Oppoſition and thirdly as we are to mind the Signs and Houſes they are in, according to all which, they \n〈◊〉\n much Malice, and mutual Hatred among Men in ſuch Families where there are different perſwaſions, and different Relations, there will be more than uſual ſtrife, and debate; ſo likewiſe in ſuch Kingdom \n〈◊〉\n, and Republicks where there are different Religions, or People of different Intereſts and Cuſtoms there will be ſturdy ſtruglings and \n〈…〉\n among them; many furious and malicious debates.\n               \nVenus Lady of the Sign wherein the Eclipſe is being \n〈◊〉\n\n\n•\nall, and in ſquare to Jupiter, denotes ſome difference and diſcord among the more religious and civiliz'd ſort of People, and that too many will be more intent upon trivial diſcents, than in minding the Intreagues and Machinations of the common Enemy of them all.\n\nMercury in the 12th Houſe Peregrine and Retrograde, ſignifies \n〈◊〉\n and Impriſonment to many forward and over nimble witted Scribes, Clarks, and Accountants, and uſers of falſe Weights and Meaſures.\nThe Luminary Eclipſed, is Lord of the 10th Houſe; and therefore is a doeble Significator of Grandees, among whom there will be many and fact Diſorders and Diſaſters, both to their Perſons and Authorities.\nAs the Eclipſe is in an Airy Sign it ſignifies vehement Winds, a Sea\n•\n city of Proviſion, and Apparitions in the Air.\nAs it is in the Sign Libra, it imports a declertion of Juſtice, ſmall Piety and little Piety, and it being Matutine, it's effects is much Augmented; ſo being in an equinoctial Sign, it's Influence will be Univerſal; it troubles the Church, and ſpoils Seeds and Herbs.\n\nAs it is in a Humane Sign, it implies much trouble among Men.\n\n\nAs it is in the Aſtriſm of the Virgin, it ſignifies a barrenneſs of the Earth, and barrenneſs among Women, many Miſcarriages, and abortive Births.\n\n\nBecauſe this Eclipſe begins in the 12th Houſe of Heaven, receives it's greateſt obſcurity in the 11th, and ends in the 10th: Hence follows Conſpiracies, a great decay of Friendſhip, and troubles in moſt States and Governments.\n\n\nFrom the great Strength and good Aſpect of Jupiter in this Eclipſe, I do heartily believe alſo, that there will be many good Moſeſes to ſtand in the Gap, and good Abrams to plead with God for averting the groſs of thoſe evils.\n\n\nI know well enough, that there are great differences among the Aſtrologers of different Religions in applying the difference and Signification of Jupiter: Proteſtant Religion; Popiſh Aſtrologers make him to ſignify their Religion, and Pagans will have him to patronize their Devorcem; there Reaſons all are the ſame, becauſe every one of them accounts their Religion the beſt; they will therefore have the beſt Planet for it's Significator.\n\n\nBut undoubtedly, that is the beſt Religion that worſhips the one only living and true GOD after the beſt manner; which muſt needs be that which moſt nearly agrees to his own Inſtitution, and meddles leaſt with the Precepts of Men; for GOD, who requires Men to worſhip hem, though fit to preſcribe him a Rule for his Direction, and leaſt that Rule ſhould be forgotten or corrupted, he commanded it to be written in a Book, which Book can be no other than that which contains the Old and New Teſtament, and is called the Bible. That Religion then that moſt ſtrictly obliges Men to keep cloſe to the dictates of this Book, is truly accounted the beſt Religion.\n\nBut foraſmuch as Jupiter is the general Significator of all Religion and Laws, he therefore ſignifies that Religion which is uppermoſt in any Kingdom or State, and which is eſtabliſhed by Authority, and the Laws of that Nation, whether it be Proteſtant, Papiſt, or Pagan; ſo Saturn, Mars, and Mercury, are the common diſturbers of Religion, and the conſtant troublers of States.\n\nNovember the 7th, there is a Conjunction of the Sun, Venus and Mercury all in ſquare to Saturn, and alſo in ſquare to the places of Saturn and Mars in this ſolar Eclipſe; this will put the Eclipſe upon Action, and ſet the oppoſition of Mars and Saturn at work too: Some notable buſineſs now on Foot, wherein a Woman or Women are much concerned, great Counſels and Conſults how to Confront the riged Impulſes of a ſturdy old Senior; much buſtle and baſeneſs, foul and turbulent Weather.\n\n\nAbout the 11th or 12th of November there is a quartile of Jove and Mars, Mars being then on the very place of the Eclipſe, and Jove in ſquare to it; diſputes ariſe about civil and military Matters, Rights and Priviledges warmly debated in ſome Places, the Religious are like to be moleſted, many Duels, Law-ſuits, and pecunary Controverſies, Fevers, and Pluriſies: But the Sun, Venus, Mercury, all in Conjunction, and in Sextile to Mars, will by great Good and wiſe Counſel, mightily moderate thoſe matters.\n\nDecember the 11th, the Sun beholds the place of his Eclipſe by a ſquare, which ſignifies ſome ſmall diſguſts among Perſons of Quality, and ſome Bickering between Rulers and their People; but the Sun ſoon lighting with the Conjunction of Jupiter, ſets all to rights again after a little Conſultation and Bluſtering.\n\nJanuary the 15th 1700, there is a ſquare of the Sun and Mars, and tho' they behold not the place of the Eclipſe, it will be worth Obſervation, by reaſon Mars is Lord of the Aſſendant, and the Sun Lord of the 10th in the Eclipſe; Mars being now near cuſp of the Aſcendent in his own Houſe, and the Sun in his detrement, Some Grandees meet with notable buſineſs and buſtle about this time from their own Subjects and Servants.\n\n\nThe 12th of February, there is a Conjunction of the Sun and Saturn\nin Piſces, the Sun Lord of the 10th in the Eclipſe, and Saturn Lord of the 3d and 4th. Sickneſs and moleſtation to Grandees ſucceeds, many die with Agues, Dropſies, and Conſumptions; much Snow or Rain, dark wet and ſlabby Weather.\nMarch the 9th, the Sun comes to the oppoſite place of the Eclipſe, and the New-Moon happens near the ſame time, which will make the Ingreſs very ſignificant: It will be a time of much Conſultation, Congratulation, and Condoleance too in ſome places; to which purpoſe, there will arrive many Agents and Ambaſſadors in the Courts of Princes; for there is alſo a Conjunction of the Sun and Mercury ſoon after the Ingreſs, beſides the Trine of Mars and Mercury, and the Sextile of Jupiter and Mercury. March the 30th, there is an Oppoſition of Mars and Venus, from the Signs on the Aſcendant and 7th Houſes in the Eclipſe; and both Planets beholding the places of Saturn and Mars in the Eclipſe with a ſquare: This Imports much noiſe and buſtle in ſeveral Places, as Poland, Loraine, Swizerland, and Ireland; cold and bluſtering Weather.\n\nApril the 12th, there is alſo an Oppoſition of Mars and Mercury in the like manner, which will import much News of much Knavery acted both by Sea and Land. The Merchants ſuffers greatly by Storms and Pirates; the Roads are now more than ordinary infeſted with Padders, and the Town with Shop-lifters, and ſuch like Creatures. April the 27th, we have an Oppoſition of the Sun and Mars from the ſame Signs, i. e. Taurus and Scorpio. More noble Gameſters now mount the Stage, and more notable Exploits are Play'd; but there is no nobleneſs in the uſe of Punniards or Poyſon, nor is it a noble Death to come to the Ax or Halter about it; nor does every one that falls in a Duel die in the Bed of Honour. We expect much Thunder and Lightning,\n\n\nIn Mars there is no material bad aſpect that has any regard to the Eclipſe: Therefore, we are only to expect thoſe evil Influences we have mentioned, to be manifeſted in this Month. Mighty endeavours will be alſo uſed herein to moderate Diſorders, and bring things into a better poſture.\n\nJune the 10th, the Sun comes to the ſquare of the Eclipſe, and near the ſame time there is a ſquare of Saturn and Mercury; ſome diſlikes ariſe among high and low; the Ears of Merchants grated with bad News; ſome cold guſts of Wind and Rain; and yet the Month affords much good Intelligence too.\n\nJuly affords us 4 Oppoſition to be conſidered, though neither of them much affects the Eclipſe. The Oppoſition of Jupiter and Mercury ſignifies Law-ſuits, Religious Diſputes, ſcribling Controverſies and haſty Showers. The Oppoſition of the Sun and Jupiter ſignifie, diſcord among Princes and Prelates, Grandees and their Truſtees;s Eighty proings and connings in Counſel; high Words, high Winds, and fierce Showers. Oppoſition of Saturn and Venus, ſignifies much\ndetrement to Women, and Fruits; cool and wet Weather The Oppoſition of Saturn and Mercury, ſignifies many ſly and deceitful tricks among Men, malicious and ſuttle Projects, Lies and Libels, Fears and Jealouſies, Colds and Gripes, Storms and Ship wracks.\n\nAuguſt the 7th, the Sun tranſites the place of Mars in the Eclipſe, and the 9th day he paſſeth by the Oppoſition of Saturn therein too, and ſoon after lights with the actual ſquare of Mars, and Oppoſition of Saturn; and before the Month ends, there will be a ſquare of Saturn and Mars: great Calamities are hereby ſignified both to great Perſons and great Places; fiery meatures in the Air, and fiery Paſſions in Men; great Fires and Fevers are much to be feared; many Deaths and Dangers inſident to many about this time; much Cruelty and hard Uſage both by Sea and Land; violent Plots and Projects; in ſome Places the Harveſt ſuffers by bad Weather.\n\nSeptember the 12th, the Sun returns to the very place of his Eclipſe; after which, the virtue of the Eclipſe will dwindle; but other bad Influences are ſtill in Operation.\n\nOctober the 30th, there is a Conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in 26 degrees of Capricorn, which uſually operates upon Religion and Law, many times violent Preaching, and violent Practice; military Impoſitions, and military Executions; much boldneſs and bluſtering.\n\nNovember the 6th, the Sun comes to the ſquate of Mars in the Eclipſe, and the 8th, to thk ſquare of Saturn therein; this will ſtir up a troubleſome Ferment among Grandees, much Spleen and Annimoſity among them, vexatious Counſels and Conſults.\n\nDecember the 28th, there is a Conjunction of Saturn and Mars in 10 degrees of Piſces; much holy Hipocriſy is thereby ſignified; many angry Pulpit Peals, Sciſm and Sedition zealouſly urged; Law debates, and Pecunary Troubles; great Ship-wracks, and many Men drowned; great Rains, or much Snow; Floods, and overſwelling of Riverss\n\n\nIt is vvorth Obſervation, that the Planets Mars has been no leſs than 7 Months this Year in Scorpio; during vvhich time, he variouſly Diſputes all the reſt of the Planets; many and great Marſhal Conſultations are thereby ſignified, and much military Povver impoſed upon ſeveral Places under Scorpio, and it's oppoſite Sign, beſides other Places. All ſorts of Chriſtians that are at War vvith the Governments of Algler, Tunis, or Tripoli, vvill be too often Kidnab'd by thoſe Rovers.\n\n\n\n\n                  Luna Eclipſed Febuary, 23 at 5 h. 20 m. Mane. 1700. Digits Eclipſed, 11 total duration 3 h. 30 m. Therefore it's effects will be conſiderable & hold in force near 4 Months.\n               \n\nObſerving no formidable Configurations a\n••\nending this Eclipſe, I was once in the mind not to concern my ſelf with it: But having conſidered the Time, and erected the Figure (you here ſee) for the ſame, I found the Poſition ſo remarkable, that I reſolved not to omit its Interpretation according to the beſt of my mean Skill, which with as much freeneſs of Mind as I dare uſe, my Reader ſhall have in the Sequel.\n\n\nHad Aſtrologers the liberty to write what they may well deduce from the Stars, a mean Artiſt might eaſily ſhame the moſt obſtinate Antagoniſt out of his ill Humour againſt Aſtrology; but our Pens are Padlock'd, and we dare not force their Freedom.\n\n\nThe Rulers of this Eclipſe are Jupiter and Mercury, the latter being Lord of the Sign where the Eclipſe is, and the former ſole Governour of the Angles ſucceeding: 'Tis well when Religion and Law guides the Helm of Government, provided they are in a Capacity to hold it; we find both thoſe Planets in a pale and ſickly Condition; Jupiter in the 12th Houſe in his Fall, and Mercury between the Square of Mars, and Conjunction of Saturn, alſo haſtening into his Fall: Hence comes much Sorrow and Perplexity to many that wear the Long Robe, from\nthe Higheſt to the Loweſt Degrees among them; behold Mars in the 9th Houſe, Saturn in the Aſcendent, and the Eclipſe in the 7th.\n\n\nAll Eclipſes of the Moon moves Tumtlts and Commotions: but moſt of all when in the \n•\nth Houſe, then Wars and Rumours of Wars, Riots Routs, and Re\n••\nſions are much to be feared; I mean, a cautionary Fear, not in L\n•…\n\n\n•\nuſilanimity.\n\n\nThe Moon is\n\n〈◊〉\n\nthe 6th Houſe; Servants and Subjects will be apt to riſe up and \n••\ntend with their Maſttrs and Rulers, joining force with their Enemies againſt them, though they ſuffer ſeverely for it.\n\n\nI am ſorry to ſee Jove ſo weak and helpleſs, he lately ſlighted Mars, and now Mars will as much ſlight him; but the Sun makes haſt to his Aſſiſtance, and to perſwade Mars into a better Humour, that more \n•\nar\n•\n may be taken to ſupport a feeble Authority, ſo made by their own Remiſneſs.\n\nSaturn and the Dragon's Tail in the Aſcendent, ſignifies much Sorrow and Diſcontent to the People in ſeveral Countries and Places; much murmuring and muttering at their Superiors, great and grievous Complaints of Poverty and hard Uſage; a Sickly Seaſon is much to be feared, and many Diſmal Accidents; Cold and Dark Air, Fewds and Fears many ſuffer by Hunger and Cold; great Ship-wracks, Floods, and Inundations, doing abundance of harm.\n\nMars in the 9th Houſe, and in a watery Sign and ſtrong, ſignifies grea\n•\n Preparations for Sea-force, and Sea-Actions; many ſtout Men of War at Sea on all ſides, to watch the motions and Deſigns of each other. The Moon applies to the Sextile of Mars, and the Trine of Jupiter; many long and dangerous Voiages made in expectation of great Advantages; but if it prove not otherwiſe, it will be well; for the Sea looks grim and angry in this Face of Heaven.\n\nMaximae Eclipſis & maximae Operantus: The greater the Eclipſe is, the greater are it's Effects; this is a great Eclips, and therefore it will be of as great Signification. Significantit Eclipſis decreta ſunt ejus quae proprius cardines: Thoſe Eclipſes which are Viſible had near unto an Angle \n•\no moſt powerfully manifeſt their Influence. This is in the \n•\nth Houſe, and therefore will ſtrongly ſtir up Wars, Contentions, Strife, and Debates among Men. Maxime illuſtres effectus ſunt Solis & Luna: Great and Famous are the Effects ſignified by the Sun and Moon; therefore, great and famous are the ſignifications of their great Eclipſes.\nThe greatneſs of all thoſe three Eclipſes we have here treated on, and the great and ſtupendions Effects likely to ſucceed them, will make abundance of Admiration in the World.\n\nEx Eclipſibus magni proveniunt: From Eclipſes great Effects always ſucceed. Eclipſis Luminarium ſupper reivitates. Provincias & Regna magis quam ſuper privatae conditionis homines antetiam ſuper Reges reſpiciunt enim multitudinem: Eclipſes pour down their Influences upon Men of mean Condition, or upon Kings themſelves; for they principally reſpect the multitude.\nBut we are not from hence to conclude, Princes too great, or Peaſants too little for the cognizance of Eclipſes; for ſince the Sun ſignifies the Nobility, and the Moon the Mobily; Eclipſes of the Sun ſurely affects the one, and Eclipſes of the Moon the other accordinly; for as we may compare the Nobility to one Body, and the Commonality to another, ſo \n••\nch Prince we account a Member of the one Body, and each Peaſant a Me— of the other; and we ſay, that Eclipſes do not only concern thoſe Bod\n•\n\n\n〈◊〉\n\n\n•…\neral; but alſo more ſpecially mind ſuch particular Members whoſe rad\n•…\n\n\n•…\nminaries are touched by the Eclipſe.\n               I know two or three Grandees in the World menaced by theſe Eclipſes; but Potlomy's Nemo Perticularia Predicit ſhall be my Rule in that matter; for though I know a Man may prodict many Particulars; I do alſo believe he ought not at all times no do it.\nBut this let me mind my Reader, that theſe three Eclipſes much concerns Governours and Governments, as he may ſee by the Schemes themſelves; for in the firſt Lunar Eclipſe the Moon is Lady of the 10th, and beſides her Eclipſe, ſhe is otherways much afflicted: So in the Solar Eclipſe the Sun is Lord of the 10th, and the 10th Houſe much afflicted; and here Jupiter Lord of the 10th is much debilitated.\nThis Eclipſe falling in the Weſt Angle, we muſt allow it 9 Months repe of before it ſtarts up into Action, and that will bring us to the 23d day of November; unto which, if we add 3 Months and a half for the duration of it's Influence, we ſhall find December 1700 January, Feburary, and part of March 1791, are aſſign'd for the manifeſtation of it's Effects; but that an Eclipſe ſhould be in one Winter, and not operate untile the next, our modern Artiſts do ſcarcely believe; but we hereing adhere to the dictates of the Antients, though we do alſo believe what we know to be true, that no Eclipſe is guilty of Idleneſs in the mean while; ſo that an Eclipſe of the Moon falling in the 7th Houſe, it will be a compleat Year in Operation, eſpecially when great: but will moſt vigorouſly manifeſt it's Effects in the latter past of time aſſign'd.\nFrom the long tranſite of Mercury in the Earthy triplicity much News may arrive from the Southern parts of the World; many Southeon winds, Chappings and Trembling, of the Eath, a Scarcity of Proviſion and deterement to young Cattel: many haſty ſhowers of Hail and ſudden Froſts.\n\nFebruary the 11th. 1701, there is an Eclipſe of the Moon in the Firſt decanate of Virgo, which ſignifies redition and diſcord, ſterility and Cold Weather, an aptneſs to Tumults and Commotions, The latter part of the ſame Month there is a Conjunction of Saturn, Sol and Mercury in Piſces: Serious and Subtile conſultations are thereby ſignified about matters of no mean Importance: it alſo denotes Storms and Shiq wracks, Cold and dark Air, much Snow or Rain.\nAbout the middle of June 1701 all the Seven Planets will be in Watery Signr: Saturn, Jupiter and the Moon, in Piſces: Mars, Sol, Venus and Mercury in Cancer: Sure ſome mighty ſhow is now made, and much buſineſs don upon the great Waters: great Fleet at Sea, both men of War\nand Merchant-men; great counſels and Conſults in Watery places and about Watery matter; many ſhowers, ſwelling Seas and Ship-wracks.\n               \nJuly the 24th 1701, there is a conſiderable Eclipſe again of the Sun Viſible to moſt parts of Europe: It falls in the Second decanate of the Regal, fiery, and Fixed Sign Leo.\n\nIt creates much trouble in the Courts of Princes and moleſts Grandees with mighty mutation fixed and fatal evils: the luminaries being then near the Body of Mars, Barrenneſs of the Earth may be feared and ſo many great Fevers and Epidemical diſceaſes: Rome and other places in Italy will be much ſublect to fire and Faction, fie\n•\nce Thunder and Lighting in many places.\n\nOcttober the 2d 1701, there is another oppoſion of the two infortunes from Virgo and Piſes, which creaters much diſcenſion between People of different Religions, intreſts and cuſtoms; or if you would have it more plain, it moves the old leaven of ſploun and Anger between Turk and Chriſtian, Papiſt and Proteſtant; ſuch as are eſtabliſhed by the Authority of nations, and thoſe that conferm not to their modes of Governmene and Worſhip; it alſo Peſters Governmedts with Plotters, the Roads with Padders, and the Sea with Pirates; Cold and Bluſtring Weather.\n\n\n               And now a litrle Application, and ſo we'll Conclude.\n               It is ſo, that Eclipſes when Great have ſo great Influence and effects; then let all People Nations and Languages unto to whom theſe three Great Eclipſes are Viſible, look about them: but more particularly, ſuch places whom they affect by the Signs of the Heavens they fall in, by the Eclipſe's Circle of Poſitions, and by the Circles of Poſition of the infortunes.\n\nTurky, all three Eclipſes of the Moon are in Virgo: great ore the Troubles and moleſtraoions thou muſt ſhare in; many will be the Tumults and Commotions in thy territories or Confines.\n\nFrance, thy Great City Paris is much conce\n•\nned, and ſome other places within thy Limits thou art ſtell Vexing thy Poor Proteſtant ſubjects, and Heaven is preparing a vexation for thee, and thoſe that puts thee upon ſuch Meaſures.\n\nItaly, much Trouble houers over thy Head; ſume of thy Princes cant agree with each other, thy Pontifical ſee will be Troubling, and muſt look to be Troubled.\n\nSavoy, thy ſeverity to the Poor Mondovites will be \n•\netali\n•\ned e'er long with intreſt.\n\nSpain, ſome Clandeſtine Overtures attend thee, and much in a little time will accrew, thou haſt much more weighty matters to diſpute then the diſturbing of the Scots at Darien who will not eaſily be Bang'd from their Poſt if their Friends fail them not of timely ſupplys, and they agree among themſelves\n\nPortugal, thou haſt been a great while fiuiet and modefately thriving: But if theſe to Lunar Eclipſes in oppoſition to thy Palladium and the Tranſite of Saturn thro' it, Produce thee no Trouble and Toyl, it will be well: but I doubt the Contrary.\n\nGermany, many places within thy confines afe concerned, matters of much moment fall on the Fronteers of Auſtra, and Subburbs of Vienna.\n\nPoland and Muſcovy look well to the Tartar and let your Chriſtian Neighbours alone, ſo they begin not with ye: But take the beſt care you can to prevent inteſtine Diſcord, that no detrement come from thence: nor be not to forward to fall out with erch other, for that will be good for neither.\n\nSweedland and Denmark, you have Enjoy'd Peace many Years while your Neighbours have invvlved don't be ſo eager for Trouble as to (Rather then Fail) deſign the diſturbance of each other, look well to your Confines, and live Ffindly together; but if you cannot, or will not, I can't help it.\n\nHolland, thy great Trade and induſtry is envied, Clandeſtine deſigns are forming againſt thee, look well to inſurrecteons, and inundations.\n\nHybernia Both the Infortunes in the Sun's Eclipſe, ſquares thy Aſcendant, which imports thee ſome Trouble, and bids thee take what care thou canſt to prevent it; ſeditious Spirits will ſtrive to diſturbe thee; the Rapparees will be buſy, both open and clandeſtine Projects will be acted about thee, and in thee.\n\nBrittannia, thou art the land of my Nativity, I dare not Item thee, but I hope I may Pray for thee, and for thy Mighty Monarch King WILLIAM God ſend him a long Life, and a Proſperions Reign over thee, and bleſs thee from Tumults, Gires, Fevers, and Furious Commotions.\nThus have I fathfully and truly (according to Art) related the ſignification of theſe three Viſible Eclipſes that are great and remarkable in themſelves, and falls out under as great and remarkoble Poſitions of the Heavens; and therefore will have as great and remirkable Effects in the World.\nI could (but for brevity's ſake) have courted my Authours; however, I have written nothing without Art, nor without the Authority of the beſt Artiſts; nor do I intend hereby to amaze the World with thoſe Coeleſtial Perſages; but to let them ſee the dangers impending, that all poſſible care may be taken to prevent them.\n\nFINIS.\n", "image_url": "A87815/00002.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life; therefore make out your intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt by Faith without which you can have no true peace, but if you take up comfort and expect peace from any duties of your own, or any thing of your own, yea, if you take up comfort from the mercy of God, or from the promiſe, without Chriſt in the promiſe, if you take not hold of Chriſt in the promiſe, your comfort will not hold, becauſe you lay hold of peace without true right to it, is Chriſt moſt precious and ſin moſt hateful.\n", "image_url": "A23642/00013.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

That Juſtice was corruptly adminiſtred, and Offices appertaining to Juſtice dearly bought and ſold. 2. Benefices and Eccleſiaſtical Dignities unworthily collated upon Men that deſerved no other Titles than of common Rogues and Cheats; Men that were many of them unskilful in the Word of Righteouſneſs, and others that were Perſons of unſound Principles, and of worſe Morals; their Doctrines tending highly to enſlave the Nation, and their Morals to debauch it. This was the Advice of an old Friend of yours, and a great-Prop of the Church of Rome, Cardinal Mazarine, whoſe Counſel and Advice it was, To debauch the Kingdom of England, and make them Atheiſts, and then they would be ſoon good Papiſts. This was in the Year 1654. at which time you, and your Party, were but at a low ebb; but how much you purſued the Counſel of the old Cardinal, I leave all reaſonable and unbyaſſed Men to judge; and how your ſneaking Eccleaſtical Paraſites contributed towards it. It is plain enough to any man that will look back into thoſe Times, There was one Jones, your Chaplain, who you ruined, becauſe he would have contributed to the advancing the Proteſtant Religion in your Family, according to his Office and Calling of a Miniſter in the Church of God. You may remember by whom Biſhopricks, and other Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, were thus procured truly by your Popiſh ſelf, and Popiſh Whores; Popiſh Pimps, and Popiſh Bowds; and not without Money, or ſome Promiſe to favour your Catholick Deſigns; and how they ſuffered your quondam Conſort to apoſtatize to the Church of Rome, it is well known.

You no ſooner received the Teſtimony of their Affections, but you forget it; and therefore it was well obſerved of Kirton your old Friend and Fryar, that the only way for a Man to ruin his Family, was to engage in your Cauſe and Quarrel. You will do well to call to mind the Heats that you and your Incendiaries created in Holland, and the Animoſities you cauſed, which coſt the De Wits their Lives. Several Letters of Coleman's to the Jeſuits of S. Omers, do highly magnifie your prudent Conduct\nin that Affair; and what was the End of all thoſe Heats and Flames you kindled, but to exaſperate a conſiderable Party of Men againſt your Nephew the Prince of Orange; nay, your Malice againſt that Prince did not ceaſe here, but moſt unnaturally you engaged the King your Brother to abandon him, and to comply with his and the mortal Enemies of this Nation; which was ſo unnatural, that an Infidel would not have been guilty of ſuch Ingratitude as your ſelf, if you do but remember how the Prince's Father ſerved yours. Your Malice yet went further; for the Lord Arlington uſing ſome Arguments with the King to have a more Regard to his Nephew the Prince of Orange, and the States-General of the United Provinces: What Care on the contrary did you uſe to prevent any good Intention of the ſaid Lord Arlington towards the ſaid Prince of Orange; and in order to this, you diſpatch'd Letters to Aſhby the Rector of the Engliſh College of S. Omers, and require him to write to the Confeſſor of the Emperor, to ſatisfie him that the King your Brother intended no leſs than the Ruin of the Confederates, eſpecially of the Empire, and of his Catholick Princes under him, and that underhand he furniſhed the Hungarian Rebels againſt his Imperial Majeſty, and found them Money to go on with their Rebellion, and that his Deſign was, not to have any Alliances with his Imperial Majeſty but only in Shew, that he might advance his Nephew the Prince of Orange; and in order to that, he had brought him over to the French Interest, which Letter, Sir, I ſaw, and the Inſtructions were followed to a Tittle by the Fathers at S. Omers.\nIn thoſe Letters the States-General were to be acquainted with this. Now, Sir, it is well known, that the King your Brother's being ingaged in the French Intereſt, was no Secret at the Court at Vienna, nor with the States-General; but that the Prince of Orange was drawn into that Intereſt, this muſt be ſurprizing: Therefore, Sir, we might eaſily ſee the ſecret Hatred you conceived againſt the Prince and his Cauſe, and Intereſt. You and your Conſpirators could have been heartily glad of being bleſt with ſuch an Ally; but becauſe he was true to his Cauſe and Intereſt, you by your lying Jeſuits did what you could to create a Jealouſie in the then Confederate Princes, of the Sincerity of the Prince, to the Confederacy, and to the Intereſt of the United Provinces, in order to his Ruin. Theſe Letters that were ſent to the Emperor's Confeſſor, bore Date, Jan. 4. 1678. Stilo Novo.\n\nSir, You may not forget the 12 Jeſuits that Whitebread the Provincial of the Jeſuits ſent into Holland to create a Belief in the Dutch, that the Prince of Orange deſigned no leſs than the Subverſion of the Government of the United Provinces, by procuring his Party to receive and own him as their King, and that it was the Deſign of the ſaid Prince to aſſume the Title and Crown of a King, and change their Government, and make a Seiſure of their Freedoms. Theſe Jeſuits were ſent by Virtue of Letters ſent from Coleman in your Name, and Money was ſent over to be received at Dunkirk, the Sum was 4000 Crowns, to bear the Charge of the Miſſion into Holland, and the Bills were ſigned by one Busby a Merchant here in London, the Money being paid in by Sir Allen Apſley; therefore, Sir, it may well be concluded who was at the Head of this Piece of Villany.\n\nIn a word, Sir, you ſee what means you and the reſt of your Popiſh Incendiaries uſed to beget in the Dutch an ill Eſteem of the Prince of Orange, and to widen the Difference between the Loviſtein Party and his Friends; and, if poſſible, to ſeduce his Friends, and deſtroy his Intereſt, and the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion: and the beſt Title the Jeſuits of St. Omer's us'd to give him, was Apple-tree Will; at which you were pleaſed; in the multitude of your witty Thoughts, to laugh, as Coleman us'd to tell us, when ever any Diſcourſe happened concerning the Prince of Orange.\nBut, Sir, you may ſay, That he was your Siſter's Son, and that at that time you had married your Daughter to him, ſo that he was not only your Nephew, but your Son-in-Law, What then? How you and your Party uſed him, when he was your Nephew, the Princes of Europe ſaw, and the Honeſt Party of England reſented his Uſage, and had Thoughts of you accordingly, yea, and of your Brother to; but you pretend that you had married your Daughter to him. No, Sir, it was neither you nor your Brother married the Lady Mary to the Prince of Orange; it was ſomething elſe, I had almoſt ſaid the Siege of Charleroy, and the Advice of a worthy Miniſter of State upon the ſame: But ſuppoſe you had married your Daughter to the Prince of Orange, and that it was your own Inclination, to which I cannot yet be reconciled in my thoughts, but that after the Marriage you purſued his Ruin with as much vigour as you did before, give me leave to ſum up the whole in a few words: You and your Accomplices reſolved, That the Prince of Orange ſhould not become Great, therefore he muſt be deſtroyed; and in order to effect ſo mighty and ſo great a Work, all means are uſed to ſtir up the Dutch to mutiny againſt him, upon that Diabolical Suggeſtion of your Conſpirators, That he had deſigned, and was reſolved to ſubvert their Government, and uſurp a Crown and Title of a King: the Emperor is alſo inſtigated to create a Belief in the States-General, That the Prince deſigned the making himſelf Abſolute; and oh how did you and your Party hug your ſelves with the Expectation of a Breach between him and the States-General, ſo that his and the whole Proteſtant Intereſt might fail in Holland.\nIn truth, when a Man reflects upon this Affair, he would wonder at your Barbarity, and naturally ask this Queſtion, Why ſhould this Prince aim at the Deſtruction of the Prince of Orange? Was he not his Siſter's Son, his Son-in-law? What profit would it be to you to deſtroy him? An honeſt-thinking Man would heſitate at theſe things; but when he conſiders who it is attempts this, and for what cauſe, then it naturally follows there was a pretended Cauſe for ſuch Diabolical Suggeſtions, and ſuch Barbarous Deſigns.\nYou that was his Uncle was converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal, as not to regard any thing in the World in compariſon of the Converſion of Heretical Kingdoms, and ſo your Intereſts we know were inſeparately united to the French King, that it was impoſſible to divide them: You know that you uſed all means to ſecure His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Intereſt in England, and that for many weighty Reaſons; one among the reſt was, That his and yours prevailing, would give the greateſt Blow to the Proteſtant Religion that ever it receiv'd from its birth; then undoubtedly\nthe Prince of Orange (through God's mercy now our Gracious King) at that time ſtood within a ſtep or two of the Throne, and being a Proteſtant, ought in all Policy to be removed, notwithſtanding his being your Nephew, and Son-in-law: For what do Men talk of natural Affection amongſt Popiſh Princes? Was you not in a Conſpiracy againſt Charles the Second, when he was at Bruxels, though he was your own Brother, (or elſe he is baſely bely'd?) And was not the Queen, his Mother, zealous in the ſame Conſpiracy, notwithſtanding he was her Son? Why then ſhould any Man talk of natural Affection?\n               Sir, you cannot forget that you had a mighty Work upon your Hands, that was, The Converſion of theſe Kingdoms, and ſubduing the Northern Hereſie, and that your hopes of it were very great, and that you were zealous, to a miracle, of being the Author of ſo Glorious a Work: Your mighty Mind, and the Mighty Mind of the French King, were relied upon by the Conſpirators; for that alſo that the Intereſt of the French King was highly attracted to that of yours. Why then ſhould any wonder at your Paſſing a Bill of Excluſion upon the Prince of Orange, who the World knew (notwithſtanding all your Helliſh Suggeſtions both to the Emperor and States-General) ſtood ready with all his might to Baffle You, and the French King, and all your mighty Undertakings.\nConſider further, That the Intereſt of the French King was highly attracted to your Intereſt; and this pleaſed you and your Party, and ſo you thought your ſelves ſecure: But here was your Nephew and Son-in-law; his Intereſt was as highly attracted to that of England, Holland, and the Reformed Churches of Europe, to the Support of the Proteſtant Religion, which You and the French King were to deſtroy by the Name and Title of the Northern Hereſie. I pray then what ſignifies a Nephew and a Son-in-law in ſuch a Caſe as this? Can any Man that ever knew you, believe that natural Affection ſhould interpoſe and prevent your deſtroying him, ſince your natural Affection and Bigotry were, and are ſtill no Strangers in England or Holland.\n\nConſider once more, and then I have done with this Point: You may remember, that the French King did moſt generouſly offer you the uſe of his Purſe, to aſſiſt againſt the Deſigns of thoſe that were Enemies to you, and that Monarch: Nay, you know he proteſted, That thoſe that oppoſed you he ſhould look on them his Enemies; and you did as well proteſt, That thoſe who oppoſed him you would look upon them as your Enemies; and it was the Opinion of the French King, that the Parliament of England was neither in his Intereſt nor yours, and you entirely agreed with him in that Thought of his; ſo that it was your Opinion, that it was neceſſary for you both to make uſe of your joint and utmoſt Credits, to prevent the Succeſs of the Parliaments Evil Deſigns againſt you both. What, Deſigns againſt you and the French King? Yes, Deſigns againſt you, and the French King; nay, that which is more, a dangerous Plot. Who are the Plotters? And what was the Plot? my Lord Arlington was at work, without ceaſing, to advance the Intereſt of the Prince of Orange, and the Hollanders, and to leſſen that of the French King: And that he and ſeveral others were endeavouring to break the good Intelligence between Charles the Second, the French King, and your ſelf, wherefore you earneſtly\nſolicited the French King to aſſiſt with the Help of his Purſe, to prevent ſuch Rogueries.\n               Thus, Sir, you make a Tripple League, and ſet it up in Oppoſition to another: In the one, King Charles, the French King, and your ſweet Self are engaged; in the other, the Parliament of England, the States of Holland, and the Prince of Orange, are engaged: The French is to furniſh you with Money, which is the Sinews of War, the Parliament are declared Enemies, King Charles ſtands as a Cypher only; and therefore the French King, and your ſelf, put your ſelves under the ſolemn Engagements to perform what was ſtipulated, and ſtrenuouſly to aſſiſt each other againſt the Deſigns of your and the French King's Enemies; for that there was a dangerous and deſperate Deſign on foot, to advance the Prince of Orange, and to leſſen the French King: And therefore, can any think that it was unreaſonable in you, to endeavour to deſtroy him, ſince his Advancement was of ſuch a deſperate and dangerous Conſequence to the French King, your Self, and Romiſh Religion? Theſe things duly conſidered, no Man that hath his Thoughts and Judgment keeping pace with each other, but muſt from the Premiſſes rationally conclude, That you and your Incendiaries muſt have a deſign of deſtroying the Prince and his Party, and Proteſtant Intereſt in Holland, notwithſtanding any Excuſes you may make to the contrary, or your Party for you.\n\n\n               II. IRELAND.\n               Since, Sir, you have not left ſo good a Name in Holland, as you might have pretended to, it is much to be feared that, upon enquiry, your Name and Memory will not be very precious here in Ireland. If you pleaſe to give me your Company thither, I'll aſſure you, if you deſerve it, you ſhall have my good Word from thence, for all the old Favours I receiv'd from you in the Day of your Power here amongſt us; but I ſuppoſe I ſhall find ſad havock there made by you, and your Plotters, of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Civil Rights, Liberties, and Cuſtoms of the Engliſh and Proteſtant Intereſt.\nSir, it pleaſed King Charles the Second to ſend the Lord Roberts as his Vicegerent into Ireland, who was a warm Man, and not at all Popiſhly affected, and therefore not for your Turn, or one that would gratifie the Conſpirators in any one Point of countenancing Popery, and therefore you procured him to be removed; ſo that Ireland was put into ſuch Hands as your Heart and Soul could wiſh for: For whoever was Deputy, or Lieutenant, your Conſpirator, Boyle, an Archbiſhop, was the Governor; a Fellow, 'tho' of the Communion of the Church of England, yet was a well-wiſher to the Romiſh Mathematicks. So Ireland was in a fair way to be Over-run and Ruined to all Intents and Purpoſes by yours; and the Procurement of the Jeſuites.\n\nUpon the Removal of the Lord Robarts, afterwards Earl of Radnor, you remember who ſucceeded him, and what Promiſes was made by this Succeſſor, and what Terms you required from him, and how he complied, and who it was that recommended this new Lieutenant as a Perſon fit, to all Intents and Purpoſes, to execute your Deſigns: Theſe things are worthy of conſideration I aſſure you, for we have conſidered them; and what could be done in ſo little time as our King hath had, many of thoſe Abuſes have been corrected and amended. This Tool brought the Kingdom of Ireland into a ſad condition, by encouraging the Popiſh Recuſants, who are the profeſs'd Enemies to the Proteſtant Religion, and Engliſh Intereſt; by his, or rather your Encouragement, they grew more Inſolent and Preſumptuous than before that Tool of a Lieutenant came there, which was of a dangerous Conſequence to that Kingdom, and the Proteſtant Religion, and Engliſh Intereſt: And it was like to have proved Fatal to that Kingdom, had it not been in ſome meaſure prevented, by the ſending in his room that Great and never-to-be-forgotten Earl of Eſſex, whom you and your Party procured to be Murthered in the Tower, to make the Murther of the Good Lord Ruſſel leſs difficult.\n               1. For in the Firſt Place, in the Month of January 1672/3. you procured a Commiſſion of Enquiry into Iriſh Affairs, containing many Powers that were new and extraordinary, not only Prejudicial to the Engliſh, whoſe Eſtates and Titles were liable to be queſtioned, but in a manner to Overthrow the King's Acts of Settlement, which Commiſſion you cauſed to be purſued, to the great Charge and Attendance of many of the Proteſtants there: And by this means you ſhook the Peace and Security of the whole Kingdom of Ireland. It is well known, Sir, that you gave the Jeſuites great Hopes of making a fair Step to eſtabliſh the Romiſh Religion; and old Gray, the Jeſuite, in a Letter of February, 1672. exhorts the Fathers at St. Omers to be very thankful to God that he had put it into the Hearts of the King and Duke, to remember the ſad Eſtate of the Catholick Religion in Ireland; and that now there was ſome Hopes of Eſtabliſhing it there, ſince the Lord-Lieutenant was ſo well diſpoſed towards it, by the eſpecial Care of His Royal Highneſs.\nII. You were pleaſed to cauſe the Popiſh Party to be armed in that Kingdom, and ſome of them were Commanders to others; Inſtructions were given from Richard Talbot, then your Agent there, by your Order, for thoſe of the Roman Catholick Party to furniſh themſelves with quantities of Arms; and this, your Conſpirators ſaid, were to keep the Engliſh in order. This, Sir, can be proved whenever there is occaſion. No Man can think, that Sir Ellis Leyton, a Papiſt, that was Secretary to the Government, by your eſpecial Grace and Favour, ſhould not purſue the ſame Inſtructions that your Agent Talbot had received: Nay, give me leave to tell you, That your dear Brother was highly engaged to reduce that Kingdom to a Popiſh Eſtabliſhment, according to the Agreement he had made with Madam, your Siſter, to whom he had promiſed to begin the Eſtabliſhing the Roman Catholick Religion in Ireland; and that\nHigh-Maſs ſhould, in a ſhort time, be ſung at St. Patrick's, in the City of Dublin, the Metropolis of that Kingdom.\n               It is true, Sir Ellis Layton was a lewd Fellow; but there was none that did your Buſineſs, in jeſt, ſo well as he did, for the time of his reſidence in Ireland: For under the Notion of Ridiculing the Iriſh, he promoted every Man that was a Papiſt, if he had but common Senſe, and a Place open. And it is well remembred what vaſt Quantities of Arms and Ammunition were daily ſent from England to that Place, and conſiderable Quantities both from France and Spain, which your Party uſed to ſay, would do more good towards the Eſtabliſhing the Catholick Religion than ſo many Bibles: And great care, Sir, was taken by you, to ſecure the poor Iriſh Catholicks in the North, that the Planters of Ulſter, and the Scotch, ſhould give them no diſturbance; that is, in plain Engliſh, they ſhould themſelves ſtand ſtill, and be peaceably murthered by your Iriſh Cut-throats.\n3. How many Popiſh Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Coroners, Mayors, Sovereigns, and Portriffs, were made, by your Princely Care, in that Kingdom! And was this for the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Engliſh Intereſt there? No certainly; it is well known, by ſeveral Letters of yours to Richard Talbot, and Sir Ellis Layton, that the Reaſon why you gave ſuch Inſtructions, was to cruſh and ruine the Proteſtant Religion and the Engliſh Intereſt in that Kingdom; for you having Popiſh Judges, and Popiſh Sheriffs▪ you would quickly find Popiſh Juries, and Iriſh Witneſſes to ſwear any thing againſt the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry that ſtood in oppoſition to your Proceedings in that Kingdom: Then, Sir, what Security had a Gentleman of his Eſtate, when Judges, Sheriffs, and Witneſſes were againſt him? The many Inſtances of the Wrongs and Oppreſſions done to the Proteſtant Engliſh Gentlemen, the Records of your Villainous Court of Claims can tell how they were ſworn out of their Eſtates and Fortunes by your Rogues and Banditti. I am certain that this Point being gained by You, and your Conſpirators, it proved very Fatal to Ireland.\n\n4. You took great care of the Church too; not of the Proteſtant Church, but of your Popiſh Titular Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Vicar-Generals, Abbots, and others, that had Power from Rome to exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, that they ſhould be eſtabliſhed in particular. Sir, your old Friend Peter Talbot, the pretended Archbiſhop of Dublin, and your old Friend James Lynce, Archbiſhop of Tuam, both of them had been notoriouſly diſloyal to the King your Brother, in that they had long lived in Diſobedience to him, and in Contempt of his Laws: But, to cure that, you procured a Pardon for them both, which Boyle the Chancellor paſſed under the Great Seal, by your ſpecial Command and Direction; nay, you hectored your Brother when he was unwilling to paſs Talbot's Pardon, and challenged his Promiſe and Agreement made at Dover, at the Interview, with Madam his Siſter and yours: And, Sir, that all things might appear with ſome Face of Grandeur, a Meeting of all the Popiſh Archbiſhops,\nBiſhops, Vicar-Generals, Abbots, Priors, and Prieſts, for the ſettling and eſtabliſhing their Clergy, both ſecular and regular, which was connived at by your Tool of a Lieutenant; upon which the Popiſh Party grew ſo inſolent, that a Proteſtant went in danger of his Life amongſt them: nay, to preſerve their Stock, in many Places they were forced to pay Tythes to the Popiſh Prieſt, as well as to the Proteſtant Miniſter.\n               But when the Earl of Eſſex was ſent over, with much difficulty ſome ſmall Check was put to theſe inſolent Carriages of the Iriſh Papiſts; Tuam fled, and Talbot withdrew for a while, or rather abſconded themſelves, and the Publick Popiſh Schools were put down, and many ſecular and regular Prieſts did depart the Land: For which, Sir, you hated the Earl of Eſſex, and Plunket you alſo deſpiſed, becauſe he ſaid, It was not Prudence for Catholicks to live in Contempt of Law; and therefore you may remember how and by whom his end was promoted, and with what zeal you and your Party ſent him out of the World; he was of the ſame Opinion with Cardinal Howard, that in whatſoever Buſineſs Talbot was engaged, he ever ſpoiled it, and he was impudent and falſe to his Party, for which the Jeſuites turned him out of the Society; but that he might not in diſcontent leave the Church of Rome, the General of the Jeſuites procured of the Pope that he might be made a Biſhop. But this, Sir, I will aſſure you, That if Talbot when he was taken in Ireland, had been taken in England, he would have done You and your Party a ſignal Piece of Service; for Coleman had certainly given Evidence with him againſt you: So that your traiterous Correſpondency with France, and Intentions to deſtroy the Prince of Orange, and the Proteſtant Religion within theſe Realms, and all over Europe, would have been ſo fully detected, that it had been almoſt impoſſible for you to have eſcaped the hand of Juſtice. Of this, Sir, I can give a particular Account, if ever there ſhould be occaſion: And Plunket himſelf gave you ſuch an Item of Talbot's Intentions in that Point, that Coleman's Death was haſtened, and Talbot dy'd ſtrangely in Priſon, and ſo you eſcaped to do more Miſchief: And how well you rewarded Plunket for his Good will towards you, is well known; and all to oblige your Cut-throat Jeſuits, to whom they were mortal Enemies.\n5. On the 26th. of Febr. 1671. It is remembred, that for the better Encouragement of the Iriſh Papiſts, and that they might many of them live in greater Bodies together, you procured Letters from King Charles, your Brother, and a Proclamation, to give Liberty in General to all Iriſh Papiſts to live in Corporations, againſt the Act of Settlement; and to be excuſed from all thoſe Oaths that were required from thoſe who were duly licenſed according to the true intent and meaning of that Act: And your Agents, Si\n•\n\nEllys Leyton, and Richard Talbot, were very vigorous to ſee thoſe Letters and Proclamations put in Execution: Then the Iriſh flocked into Towns Corporate, and other Market Port Towns of that Kingdom, to the great Terrour of the Engliſh Proteſtants, and the Diſturbance of their Trade. To redreſs which, how many Petitions were preſented, ſetting forth the Calamity\nthe Proteſtant Intereſt was expoſed to, and what Danger they were in of loſing their Trade both at home and abroad; and how they returned without any manner of Redreſs, but were ridiculed by Leyton, and abuſed by your Tool the Lord Lieutenant.\n               It is well known that the Iriſh Papiſts (ſome few only excepted) did not underſtand Trade, and therefore the End for which they were let in to live in Towns Corporate, and into other Market-Towns within that Kingdom was, that they might over-power the Proteſtant Party and ſeize their Effects as they did in the Rebellion: They began in the Year 1641, and that they might get into Offices in thoſe Towns Corporate, to keep the Proteſtants ſo much under as would incapacitate them to ſtand upon their defence, the Iriſh being well armed, and the Engliſh being diſarmed by a private Order from your ſelf to the then Lord Lieutenant, which was diſcovered in the Papers found at Jolliff's houſe in Weldſtreet, in Feb. or Jan. 1678/9, amongſt Papers belonging to Sir Ellys Leyton.\n\nAnd for two or three Years together, great Inquiry was made by ſome of your Conſpirators, for News out of Ireland; ſo big they were with the Expectation of a Rebellion there; which certainly had been if it had not been for fear of the Scotch, who were well planted in the North of Ireland, who with all the Bravery and Reſolution that became honeſt Men and good Proteſtants to ſtand by the Engliſh, in oppoſition to the Iriſh; for which Cauſe you did uſe your utmoſt Efforts to have thoſe Scotch that were ſo planted in the North of Ireland to be diſarmed; but whether at that time your Deſign took effect I cannot well remember.\n6. Furthermore, you to carry on your wicked deſigns and purpoſes in that Kingdom for the better eſtabliſhing of Popery and Arbitrary Power, and diſcouraging of the Proteſtant Religion and Engliſh Intereſt. You procured Letters of the King your Brother, bearing date, Septemb. 28th. 1672. and upon that Letter ſo procured, there was an Order of Council of that Kingdom, in which Letter, and by which Order, the Engliſh Proteſtants were ſtrictly charged and commanded, upon pain of his high Diſpleaſure, not to proſecute the Iriſh Papiſts, in any Actions whatſoever, for any Wrongs or Injuries committed by them, during the late Rebellion. Nay, Sir, you would not have it called a Rebellion, but you deſired it might be called rather the late Troubles, which you could not obtain; and rather than your Teagues ſhould loſe the Benefit of the ſaid Letter, you were content to have it called a Rebellion; and the Reaſon was, you and your Brother too were well ſatisfied who had a hand in it, and firſt ſtirred it up; witneſs, the Parchments that were found in the Red Trunk in Jolliff's Houſe in Weld-ſtreet, and the Letter written in the behalf of the Marquis of Antrim, to your Deviliſh Court of Claims, in which the principal Author of that Rebellion was made manifeſt, but that by the Way only.\n\nIn that Rebellion, what Murders, Rapines, Thefts, and barbarous Outrages were for ſome time daily committed by the Iriſh Papiſts, upon the poor Proteſtants, ſome yet alive in both Kingdoms to teſtifie: And yet, of your tender Care of thoſe Barbarous Cut-throats, you would not have them anſwer at Law, for any of the aforeſaid Villanies, and why? Becauſe what they did, was in Zeal for the Catholick Cauſe, to which, you by a Miracle was converted, inſomuch, that for the promoting of it, you had regard neither to Law, or Juſtice, Sence, or Reaſon: Nay, ſome that did ſue thoſe Murderers before that damnable Court was ſet up, were much diſcountenanced by your Party there, and by your ſelf here in England, if they had occaſion to make any Application to your ſelf for any Favour or Kindneſs.\n               7. You conſtituted Richard Talbot Agent from your ſelf to the Roman-Catholicks, and they conſtituted him their Agent to you from them, for which Talbot had a ſufficient Penſion to whore and game withal; and, give the Devil his due, he anſwered his Truſt with all the Care, Fidelity, and Diligence both to you and the Popiſh Party. Not only ſo, but you procured for him the ſaid Talbot, a Command in Ireland, as a Reward for his great Services done. Of this Agency of the ſaid Talbot, Dr. Tongue, and Mr. Thomas Jones, your quondam Chaplain, having ſome clear Proof, they made Application to the King your Brother, and he ridiculed the Buſineſs, and ſaid, That Talbot was not only a Blockhead, but was in no manner fit for an Agent for any party, he being alſo a Man too much addicted to his pleaſures; and you met with Jones, and asked him whether he was turned from a Preacher to an Informer, and told him he had pitched upon a very unlikely man for an Agent. Thus was any Truth, that was againſt Poperty or Papiſts, brought by any honeſt Man, hiſſed of the Stage by your Brother and your ſelf. Sir, I confeſs you would have uſed me ſo when I charged him with a Commiſſion from ſome body, to be General Governour, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; and the King then told me how Tongue and Jones had been to inform him that Talbot was an Agent from the Popiſh Party in Ireland to the Duke, and an Agent from the Duke to the Popiſh Party, which he rejected as an improbable thing; but the Story I told him was more improbable: I diſcovered his Agency, and made out that by Letters under the hand of the ſaid Talbot; ſo that Tongue and Jones were juſtified, and you did, in a few Years, ſo juſtifie that part and ſo many particulars of my Teſtimony in that Affair, that your very Paſſive Obedience Rogues began, when it was almoſt too late, to look about them: For in time he was General of the Army in Ireland, in the time of the Earl of Clarendon's Regency, and after him, to the ſorrow of many Unbelievers, he was by you made Lord Lieutenant.\n8. Your Conſpirators received a Letter from Talbot, the pretended-Archbiſhop of Dublin, wherein it was expreſsly ſaid, That your Jeſuits in Ireland, and others were preparing the Iriſh Papiſts to Riſe in defence of their Liberties and Religion, and to recover their Eſtates, and that if the Parliament that was to ſit\nin England, did engage heartily with the King, and the King with them in a War againſt the French King, that a place or places ſhould be opened to receive the French King's Army in Ireland, whenever his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſhould think fit to ſend one. And by Order from Coleman and the Jeſuits in London, the Fathers at the Engliſh College at S. Omers, were to advertiſe the Father Confeſſor to the French King of the ſame; and other Jeſuits that had an Intereſt in the French King, and the Fathers of S. Omers were aſſured that the King your Brother was brought to that ſtate of Security, that if any Male-content among them ſhould not prove true to them and their Deſign, his Majeſty would not give ear to their Information, and therefore prayed them to be diligent, for now was the time or never; and accordingly Meſſengers were ſent to Father La Chaiſe, viz. Edward Nevil your Confeſſor, and William Busby, to carry the aforeſaid Letters to La Chaiſe, and theſe did bring home La Chaiſe's Anſwer, and withal ſeveral Letters that Coleman had written to him upon that Affair in your Name, and by your Command, that bore date in the month of January, as theſe alſo did in the month of January 1677/8. ſome little time before the Parliament ſat down: And then, Sir, there was a Penſion obtained for Coleman, your diligent Secretary, of 2000 Crowns a Year, and another from Rome, but what that was I do not ſo well remember: But this is not to be forgotten, that the Fathers of S. Omers had great Aſſurance of conſiderable Sums from the Pope, and from the General of the Jeſuits, if any Progreſs were made in that Glorious Attempt.\n               Here, Sir, you and your Party ſignalize your ſelves in ſeveral particulars worthy of your being put in mind of, 1. The great Preparations that were made for the Riſing of the Iriſh Papiſts. 2. That the great Deſign of Riſing, was for the Defence of their Liberties and Religion. 3. You were not certain but that your Brother might engage in earneſt with the Parliament for entring into an actual War with France. 4. That in caſe he ſhould, your Conſpirators would let in French Forces into Ireland. 5. That your Brother was brought to ſuch a ſtate of Security, that if any Malecontent amongſt you ſhould not prove true to you or your Deſign, he would not give ear to their Information.\n1. The great Preparations that were made for the Riſing of the Iriſh Papiſts, and this your Agent Talbot was engaged in, and your Secretary Coleman was privy to it, and you too, by the Letters that Coleman wrote by your Order to the ſaid La Chaiſe, with whom you your ſelf left this Jeſuit to correſpond, Coleman being a Servant to you, and a truſty one too. But there were many Proteſtants that had their Eyes opened, and made their Obſervations of the Carriage of your Teagues, how imprudently inſolent they had been, and how they were Armed and Countenanced by ſome in the Government, and therefore they can atteſt the Truth of this Propoſition of mine, and they are Men of unexceptionable Credit. So that if you will try the Merits of the Cauſe, you may come forth and be heard.\n\n2. That the great Deſign of Riſing was for the Defence of their Liberties and Religion, and the Recovery of their Eſtates. You know, Sir, that you were converted to the Religion of the Church of Rome; and you were ſo zealous for it, even to a Miracle, that you regarded nothing in the World in Compariſon of your Religion: And ſo it was with your Friends here in Ireland; and whilſt the Engliſh Proteſtants were uppermoſt, you had inſtilled this Principle in them, by your Jeſuites, and other Conſpirators, that they were but Slaves: And as for thoſe that could not recover their Eſtates, forfeited by Rebellion, by the dint of Perjury, they muſt try by the dint of the Sword to deſtroy the Engliſh Proteſtant Intereſt; or elſe they were not only Slaves, but Beggars too into the bargain.\n               3. They were not certain but that the King your Brother might engage in earneſt with the Parliament, in an actual War againſt France; you know, Sir, he had been but uncertain in his Proceedings with you in this damnable Conſpiracy, for he had broke the Engagements that he had made with Madam your Siſter, in the Eſtabliſhing the Popiſh Religion in Ireland, and that he had paſſed the Teſt Bill in England; and that he refuſed to ſign Coleman's Declaration, for the diſſolving the Parliament, notwithſtanding his ſolemn Engagements to you and your Party to do it; and that he received the Sacrament in his Chappel according to the Uſage of the Church of England, though he had received the ſame but that morning, from Ireland the Jeſuit, according to the Rites of the Church of Rome; and therefore neither Teague nor your ſelf were ſure of him.\n4. In Caſe he ſhould heartily engage with the Parliament, in an actual War againſt France, your Conſpirators would let in French Forces into Ireland, and ſo they did when you Trayterouſly Invaded that Kingdom, and what they did for you then, they would have done as much for you eight or ten Years before. They were zealous for the Popiſh Religion, and ſo were you, and your Intereſts were both one, and they are to this day; I think I need not go further to prove that Point.\n5. The King your Brother was brought to ſuch a ſtate of Security, that if any Malecontent amongſt you ſhould not be true to you or your Deſign, he would not give ear to their Information: you know who it was that ſo governed the King, and led him by the Noſe, but you ſuppoſed your ſelves ſafe: But this remember, that when Information was made of this Helliſh Conſpiracy, the King your Brother heard it, and the Evidence was ſo ſtrong, and the Plot made ſo plain, that he could not gainſay it, he being in every part of it himſelf, excepting that of his own Life; and was convinced that the Parliament ought to have the Examination of the ſame put into their hands, which was accordingly done. And what the Parliament, that was within ſome few days after the Diſcovery thereof to ſit, did do, and what Credit they gave to it, and three other Parliaments, you and your Followers cannot forget.\n\n9. Your Conſpirators, the Jeſuites from St. Omer's, were made acquainted, by Letters, from thoſe of London, in conjunction with your Servant Coleman, That William Morgan, and one Lovel, Jeſuites, were diſpatched as Meſſengers into Ireland, to ſee how Affairs ſtood there; and this Morgan's, and his Companion's Charges were paid by the ſaid Coleman, who gave them Inſtructions, in your Name, to encourage the Iriſh Papiſts, to defend their Religion and Liberties: And Coleman, and the Jeſuites tranſmitted 2000 Pound for the Supply of their preſent Wants; and a Promiſe of 4000 Pound was, in your Name, made by Coleman, and the Jeſuites, in caſe there ſhould be any Action.\n               But, Sir, theſe Meſſengers, Morgan and Lovel, they went away on the laſt of January, 1677/8. and returned the latter part of March following, and gave ſuch a melancholy Account of Peter Talbot's laviſhing the Money that you had in a ſpecial manner entruſted him withal, and not applying the ſame for the uſe of the Iriſh, as you had directed, that it ſtrook a great Damp upon the Minds of your Conſpirators here in London: and, That the ſaid Talbot had forged Receipts of ſeveral Summs of Money by him pay'd to ſeveral of their Officers, though the ſame were neither pay'd by him, nor yet receiv'd by them; and not only ſo, but that the Proteſtants in the North of Ireland were much alarm'd at thoſe Quantities of Arms and Ammunition that were put into the Hands of the Iriſh Catholicks.\n10. Your Conſpirators, Coleman, and the Jeſuites in London, receiv'd Letters from St. Omers, written from Father Ireland, (not he that was hanged, for his own Name was Ironmonger; but this Man's own Name was Saltmarſh) That Care was taken for the Deſtruction of the Duke of Ormond in Ireland, he being then Lord-Lieutenant there: And for what Reaſon? Becauſe he had refuſed, Sir, to join with you in Breaking the Engliſh Intereſt in that Kingdom; though, Sir, you may remember, that the ſaid Duke was a Perſon very Obſequious to your Brother, and your Self; and the Reaſon why you could not get him to engage with you in Omnibus, was his own Safety and Eaſe. Yet when you acted, by the King's Command, the ſaid Duke never failed you; nor did his Son, the Earl of Oſſory, which coſt that good Gentleman many a Sigh when he came to dye; for the Buſineſs of the Smyrna Fleet, and the Wicked War againſt the Dutch, ſtuck upon his Soul to the laſt Minute of his Life. But I ſay, Becauſe the Duke of Ormond would not puſh on every thing you put upon him, he was not for your turn; though, give him his due, he had gone farther than his Inclinations lead him, to pleaſe your Mind.\n11. In the laſt place, when you took the Crown, you in a ſhort time put the whole Government into the Hands of the Iriſh Papiſts, by which means the Engliſh Proteſtant Intereſt was in great danger to be loſt; and the Proteſtant Inhabitants were under the daily Fears, through your Grace and Favour, of having their Throats cut; nay many, daily, by your Cut-Throat Teagues, were, by your eſpecial Direction, baſely, inhumanely, and barbarouſly murthered. So that ſome taſted of that Cruelty which others juſtly\napprehended from the Arbitrary Power you ſet up there: Some of them left the Kingdom, and abandoned their Eſtates, calling to mind that Cruel and Bloody Maſſacre which fell upon their Fathers in that Kingdom, in the year 1641. And to crown your Work, you traiterouſly invaded that Kingdom, and called a Number of your Villains together, and chriſtened them by the Title and Name of a Parliament; and what you did by their countenance, many yet alive can tell. But Doctor King, an old Paſſive Obedience Friend of yours, hath painted you out at large in thoſe particular Carriages of yours, when you, with your French Mirmidons, invaded that Kingdom.\n               But, Sir, let me tell you, That Great William our King hath endeavoured, and doth ſtill ſtudy to bring Ireland into ſuch a State, that the Settlement of the Proteſtant Religion may there be religiouſly obſerved, and the Proteſtant Engliſh Intereſt may be ſecured againſt any Effort of yours, or your Iriſh Teagues to the contrary notwithſtanding.\n\n\n               III. SCOTLAND.\n               You having play'd your Game ſo well in Ireland, it will not be amiſs to caſt our Eye upon that Quondam Ancient Kingdom, and ſee how you managed there; for as you managed Ireland by a Tool that ſucceeded the Lord Roberts, ſo in Scotland You and your Brother acted by Lauderdale, for he brought all the Laws and Liberties of Scotland to the Council-Chamber, bringing all Perſons and Cauſes of any moment to your Arbitrary Council, who acted as Lords Paramount without controul; and ſo zealous were you, by him, to promote and ſupport the French Intereſt there, that continually new Levies were making in Scotland for the Service of the French King, tho' at that very time we were pretending a French War in England. You remember, Sir, that by your Influence upon the King your Brother, and on the Council of Scotland, you make them uſe all the diligence that was poſſible to get an Army there, to be a ſtanding Army in the room of the Militia of that Kingdom, the Militia being not thought fit for your Popiſh Deſigns: And the means to effect the ſame, you pitch'd upon thoſe you judged to be the moſt effectual; which was, firſt to Oppreſs and Enrage the Diſſenters: and this could not be better accompliſhed, than by diſturbing and proſecuting their Meetings, and Religious Aſſemblies for the Worſhip of God; which You and your Conſpirators did with all imaginable diligence. And you having found out a new way by caution, your Conſpirators deviſed a Bond ſhould be impoſed upon every Man they marked out for Ruine, as being Enemies to their Arbitrary Proceedings; which Bond was, That the Landlord ſhould be bound for his Tenant, the Maſter for his Servant, and the Husband for the Wife, and Father for the Children, not to go to Conventicles: Which you knew many would not do; for that the People of Scotland generally hated Praelatical Government. But this way they\nthought would ſo enrage the People, whom they fore-knew would not part with their Meetings, that they doubted not but to force a Rebellion; and thereupon have a fair Pretence to raiſe Forces for the Security of the Kingdom againſt reſtleſs Meeters and Meetings. Which Deſign, Sir, You and your Party in that Kingdom did at laſt effect.\n               Another Device you and your Conſpirators had of ſeizing the Field-Meetings by the armed Forces, and deſtroying them both in Bodies and Eſtates, and dragging them to Gaols, and then by whole Ship-loads ſelling them to the Plantations as Condemn'd Men; and Ship-loads coming here for London, they, by one way or another, got their Liberty. Was this of the Bond all? And was the Selling of them all? No: For You and your Conſpirators found out another way, by the Tyranny of Duke Lauderdale; and that was this:\nThere was a Warrant procured from the Council of Scotland to diſarm divers Shires and Low-lands of that Kingdom; and when that would not exaſperate them, then another Order was procured to order the High-landers, a ſort of barbarous Papiſts, to be armed, and by whole Regiments to come down upon the Inhabitants, ſpoiling and deſtroying the whole Country, living amongſt them at diſcretion; and theſe very High-landers, thus armed, under the pretence of keeping the Peace, had, in their Commiſſion from your Brother's and your Council in Scotland, Authority to live at Free Quarter upon thoſe Inhabitants, which they did divers Months together, to the deſtruction of the poor People. And all this was to procure a Rebellion at any rate.\nBut leaſt this ſhould be too general, I will deſcend to ſome Particulars, that the thing may be plain, to your Ragged Regiment at St. Germans, and your Hell-born Cut-throat Crew here in England.\n\n\nI. I will ſhew you, in ſeveral Particulars, how your Brother and You invaded the Rights of the Good People of Scotland in general.\nII. I will give you to remember ſome Inſtances of your Brother's, and your Barbarity to particular Perſons.\nIII. Your Brother's and your way of uſing your Priſoners.\n\nI. Give me leave to put you and your Conſpirators in mind of ſeveral Particulars, in which your Brother and you invaded the Rights of the good People of Scotland: And that this Point may be more plain, I will illuſtrate it in theſe following Particulars.\n1. Your Conſpirators in Scotland did moſt groſly, falſly, and impudently miſrepreſent to the King your Brother, and your Self, the Condition of the Weſtern Counties of the Kingdom of Scotland, as if they had been in a State of Rebellion; tho' it is well known that they had never made any Oppoſition to the King's Authority; nor did they reſiſt any of the King's Forces, but patiently\nſubmitted to the Execution of the Laws: But You and your Conſpirators purpoſing to have the King's Authority to carry on your ſiniſter Deſigns, You, with your Conſpirator Lauderdale, and the reſt of your Popiſh Crew, adviſed the King (who was not difficult in that Point to conſent) to raiſe an Army againſt the Proteſtants in Scotland; and a Letter was ſigned by your Brother, and ſent to the Council of Scotland. Upon the Receipt of this Letter, your Conſpirators, the Council of Scotland made out Orders for the Raiſing an Army of about Eight or Nine thouſand, the moſt or which were Popiſh Highlanders: Which, Sir, was ſo wicked a Contrivance, that the Nobility and Gentry of the Weſtern Counties did ſend to Edenburgh, and for the Security of the Peace did offer to engage, That whoſoever ſhould be ſent, the Laws ſhould be put in execution, and ſhould meet with no Affront; and that they would become Hoſtages for their Safety. Yet this Army ſo raiſed by You, and your Conſpirators, with the Colour of the King your Brother's Authority, was marched into a Peaceable Country, and did, according to their Commiſſions, take Free Quarter; and in moſt Places levied great Summs of Money, under the Notion of Dry Quarters; and did Plunder and Rob the Proteſtants, of which no Redreſs could be obtained, though Complaints were daily made of theſe Barbarities: For your Brother and You were reſolved, that nothing ſhould ſatisfie your Cruelty, but the extirpation of thoſe who did not comply, without reſerve, with your Arbitrary Proceedings.\n               2. That it was apparent, that your Deſign was not only to deſtroy thoſe that went to Field-Meetings, but alſo the whole Proteſtant Intereſt; for thoſe that were Field-Meeters, were but tenderly uſed, in compariſon of thoſe who went to Church, who were moſt quarrered upon, and deſtroyed; thoſe of the Field-Meeters, parting with their Moneys to be excuſed as long as they were able; and when thoſe poor Wretches had no more Money to ſatisfie your dragooning Apoſtles, they were miſerably uſed by them: By which means ſeveral Families were Ruined, and brought to ſtarve for want of Bread.\n3. The Proteſtants alſo were required to ſubſcribe exorbitant and illegal Bonds, which was impoſſible to be performed by them, which was againſt the Law of Nature, which is, no Man is bound to impoſſibilities, viz. That they, their Wives and Children, Servants and Tenants, ſhould live orderly, according to Law, and not go to Conventicles, or entertain Vagrant Preachers, with ſeveral other Particulars; by which Bond, thoſe that ſigned it were liable to anſwer for all Men's Tranſgreſſions that lived upon their Lands: Which was ſo hard a Caſe, that Coleman himſelf thought, that if that did not make them Rebel, nothing would.\n4. That many of the Proteſtants of that Kingdom, within thoſe Counties, were proclaimed Rebels, and Writs iſſued forth for the ſeizing of their Perſons, upon their refuſing the aforeſaid Wicked and Illegal Bond; and the Nobility and Gentry within thoſe Counties, who had been ever faithful to the Crown,\nand had appeared in Arms for the King, were Diſcharged upon Oath, and a Proclamation was by your procurement Iſſued out, forbidding the Nobility and Gentry, upon great Penalties, to keep any Horſes above Four pounds Ten groats a Piece.\n               5. That the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry of the Shire of Ayre, at your Inſtance and Suggeſtion, were, by the King's Order to the Advocate-General, indicted of High-Treaſon, and other high Crimes and Miſdemeanours. Theſe Indictments were delivered to them in the Evening to be anſwered by them the next Morning upon Oath, and when they did demand two or three days time to conſider of their Indictments, and craved the Benefit of having Counſel to adviſe withal in Matters of ſo high Concernment, and alſo excepted againſt their being put to ſwear againſt themſeves in Matters that were Capital; thoſe deſires were rejected, and were told they muſt ſwear inſtantly, or be reputed guilty.\n6. Notwithſtanding the Impoſition of the Oath was illegal; and the denying of Time to conſider of their Indictments; and to have Lawyers allowed them to adviſe withal, had never been denyed to the greateſt of Malefactors; nor, indeed, could be by the Laws of that Kingdom, yet for all this, theſe Noblemen and Gentlemen knowing their Innocency of all that had been charged upon them, did purge themſelves by Oath, of all the Particulars that were objected to them, and were thereupon acquitted, and though the Conſpirators in the Committee of Council uſed the ſevereſt manner of Inquiry to diſcover any ſeditious or treaſonable Deſigns, which were pretended as Grounds for marching that Army into thoſe Weſtern Counties, yet nothing ever could be proved. So falſe was that Suggeſtion concerning a Rebellion then deſigned by them, though heartily deſired by you and your Conſpirators.\n7. The Oppreſſions, notwithſtanding the Acquittal of thoſe Noblemen and Gentlemen of the ſaid Counties, continuing upon them, they went to Edenburg, to repreſent to the Council the heavy Preſſure they and their People lay under, and were ready to offer to them, all, that in Law, or Reaſon, could be required of them, for ſecuring the Peace: The Council being Conſpirators with your Vice-Tyrant Lauderdale, I did immediately upon their appearing there, ſet forth a Proclamation, requiring them to depart the Town within three days, upon very great Penalties. And when the Duke of Hamilton did petition for leave to ſtay for two or three days longer upon ſome very urgent Affairs of his own, that was refuſed him.\n8. That when ſome Perſon of very great Quality, had declared to the Villain Lauderdale that they would go and repreſent their Condition to the King, ſince they could not have Juſtice from his Miniſters. But to prevent that, a Proclamation was ſet forth, forbidding all the Subjects to depart the Kingdom\nof Scotland without Licenſe, ſo that the King might not be acquainted with the Condition of the poor Proteſtants, and that they might not apply to him for Redreſs though it would have been to little purpoſe, he, and you, and this Lauderdale being in the Conſpiracy to have them deſtroyed.\n               2. Give me leave in the Second Place, to remember you of ſome particular Perſons that were Oppreſſed by you and your Wicked Inſtrument, the ſaid Duke Lauderdale; they were Perſons of great Note, for their Quality and Worth, and their Oppreſſion ſo great, that the Proteſtants in Scotland were apprehenſive that all Proteſtants might be, upon the ſlighteſt Occaſions, brought under the like Oppreſſion; for you, and your Conſpirators there managed your wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes with all the Dexterity and Diligence that Men that had a Mighty Work upon their Hands, and Mighty Minds to go through with it, could do for you and your Party; there being of the Council upon many occaſions proceeded to a new kind of Puniſhment; for thoſe who would not comply with your Villanous Deſigns of bringing in of Slavery, ſo that Popery might the more eaſily be introduced into that Kingdom, viz. Of declaring Men of Publick Truſt, whereby the greateſt Perſons were Robbed of their Honour, and a Stain laid not only upon them but upon their Poſterity alſo; nay, the Parliament it ſelf was Branded with Infamy, by ſuch a Severe and Illegal Sentence by Lauderdale himſelf in the time of the Lord Middleton's Government, yet he by your Procurement, and the expreſs Command of your Brother King Charles, cauſed it to be done in the lower Courts.\nI will Sir, for the ſatisfaction of your Bloody Cut-Throats, both here at home, and your ragged Crew at St. Germains, put you in mind of ſeveral Inſtances in which that Ban-Dog Lauderdale, ſerved your Brothers and your wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes.\nYou may remember the Twelve Worthy Proteſtant Citizens of Edinburgh that were declared uncapable of Publick Truſt, againſt whom no Complaint was made as can be made out, againſt you; but you will ſay, What was the Cauſe? Then I Anſwer, Theſe Men being Magiſtrates of that City, refuſing to part with the publick Money of the City to Lauderdale for what Uſes you know well enough, they, I ſay, were turned out, and Conſpirators of your own Stamp put in their Places, and then the Publick Money was drawn out of the City's Bank at the deſire of the Conſpirators.\nThe Provoſts of Aberdeen, Glaſcow, and Gadburgh, were put under the ſame Sentence for Signing a Letter to the King your Brother, in a Convention of Boroughs, Stating a true Account of their great Oppreſſions by the Conſpirators; which Letter was Signed by the whole Body, and the Letter was adviſed by your Brother's Advocate, as a Letter that had nothing in it which could bring them under any Guilt; yet thoſe were there ſingled out of the whole Number, and Incapacitated, beſides, a high Fine and a long Impriſonment.\n\nSir Patrick Hume, ſince a Peer of that Kingdom, not of your Creation, but of the Creation of our Gracious King that now is: This worthy Perſon being ſent by the Shire of Berwick, to complain of ſome illegal Proceedings, in Order to obtain a legal Remedy and Redreſs, which he did only in the Common Form of Law, was alſo declared uncapable of Publick Truſt, beſides many Months impriſonment; and ſince then, he was another time impriſoned for almoſt one whole Year, and nothing ever was charged upon him.\n               The Provoſt of Linlithgoe being complained of, for not furniſhing ſome of your Brother's Forces with Baggage-Horſes, was called before the Council, and becauſe he ſaid they were not bound in Law to furniſh Horſes in ſuch a manner, he was immediately declared Incapable of Publick Truſt, and was both fined and impriſoned.\nYour Conſpirators, as they were diligent, doing yours and the Devils Drudgery, they ſometimes out-did themſelves to pleaſe you; for at one time they incapacitated 50 of the Town of S. Johnſtons, upon a very ſlight Pretence; inſomuch that they could not find a ſufficient number of Citizens for the Magiſtracy of that Town.\nIt is well known, Sir, that for your Brother's Service and yours, and for the carrying on of your curſed Deſigns in that Kingdom of Scotland, ſeveral Proteſtants, upon ſlight, and, oftentimes, upon no Ground, were impriſoned, and ſometimes kept Priſoners for many Months, nay Years, though nothing hath been objected to them. Some have been required to enter themſelves Priſoners, contrary to the Laws of that Kingdom; a particular Inſtance you made of Lieutenant-General Drummond, whoſe great Loyalty could never be forgotten, he was required to enter himſelf a Priſoner in the Caſtle of Dunbarton, where he was kept for eighteen Months time, nine of which he was made a cloſe Priſoner; yet nothing was objected to him to give the leaſt Colour for that uſage.\nThe Lord Cardroſs, a Man of great Virtue and Integrity, was for his Lady's keeping two meetings in her Houſe, though he was preſent at neither of them, fined Eleven Thouſand Pound Sterling; and was kept ſeveral Years a Priſoner in Edenburgh Caſtle, and was a frequent and a long Petitioner for his Liberty, and could not find for a long time the leaſt Inclination in any of the Conſpirators; nay, Application was made to the King, but from your incenſing the King againſt him, his Petition was rejected.\nBeſides all theſe illegal Impriſonments, the King your Brother, and your ſelf, had Rogues of a deeper Dye; they were Officers in your Cut-throat Army in Scotland; theſe carried with them General Warrants for the apprehending of any Perſon that the Conſpirators had a ſpite to, though under no legal Cenſure, nor have been ſo much as cited to appear, which put many of the poor Proteſtants to very great Fears as alſo to great Expence (Juſt, Sir, as your Atterburies and the reſt of your curſed Meſſengers did here in England in the time of your Tyranny.)\n\nCaptain Caſtaires, a notable Villain, and fit for a Dragooning Apoſtle for the Devil's Service and yours, did intrap one Kirkton an outed Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, into his Chamber at Edenbourgh, and did violently abuſe him and deſigned to extorted ſome Money from him; the Noiſe of this coming to the Ears of one Baily, Brother in Law to the ſaid Kirkton, he came to the Houſe, and hearing him cry Murder, Murder, forced open his Chamber Door, where he found his Brother in Law and the Captain grapling; the Captain pretended he had a Warrant againſt Kirkton, and Baily deſired him to ſhew it, and promiſed that all Obedience ſhould be given to it; but the Captain refuſing to do it, Kirkton was reſcued. This was only delivering a Man from one of your Robbers according to the Law of Nature. The Captain complained of this to your Conſpirators, and the Lord Hatton, with others of the ſame Kidney, were appointed to examine the Witneſſes; and when it was brought before the Council, the Duke of Hamilton, the Earls of Morton and Dumfrize, and Kincardin, the Lord Cocheren, and Sir Archibald Primroſe, then Lord Regiſter, deſired, that the Report of the Examination might be read; but that not ſerving the Deſigns of your Conſpirators, was denied: Thereupon thoſe Lords delivered their Opinions, That ſince Caſtaires did not ſhew any Warrant, nor was cloathed with any publick Character, it was no Oppoſition to the King's Authority, in Baily to reſcue the ſaid Kirkton: But for this Opinion, the King your Brother, and your ſelf, and Lauderdale, put theſe Lords out of the Council, and out of all Command in the Militia, and though it could have been made appear that he had no Warrant at all againſt Kirkton, but procured it after the Violence committed, and it was antedated on deſign to ſerve a turn at that time; yet the ſaid Baily was fined 6000 Marks and kept in Priſon for a long time; which ſort of Proceedings put the poor Proteſtants under ſad Apprehenſions.\n               3. Now, Sir, I pray remember how your Conſpirators uſed the poor Proteſtants when they had them in Priſon. There was fourteen Men taken at a Field Meeting, who, without being legally convict of that or any other Crime, were ſecretly and in the Night taken out of a Priſon upon a Warrant ſigned by the Earl of Linlithgo, and the Lords Hatton and Collington, and were delivered to Captain Maitland, who had been Page to Duke Lauderdale, but after, a French Officer, and was making his Levies in Scotland, and were carried over to the Service of the French King, in the Year 1676.\nYour Conſpirators in Scotland did, for your Brother's Service and yours, upon many Occaſions proceed to the moſt unreaſonable and arbitrary Fines either for ſlight Offences, or for Offences where the Fine is regulated by Law, which they have never conſidered when the Perſons were obnoxious to them. So the Lord Cardroſs was fined 11000 l. for his Ladies keeping two Meetings in his Houſe, and Baptizing a Child by an outed Miniſter, without his Knowledge; the Provoſt formerly mentioned, and Baily, and many others were alſo fined without any Regard had to the Law.\n\n4. Give me leave, Sir, to put you in mind of a fourth Piece of Villany acted by you and your Brother upon the Proteſtants of Scotland. Your Conſpirators, by your Brother's Authority, and your Procurement, did ſeveral times proceed to take away Gentlemens Dwelling houſes from them, and to put Garriſons into them, even in the time of Peace, contrary to all Law, Juſtice, and Reaſon. In the Year 1675, it was deſigned againſt twelve Proteſtant Noblemen and Gentlemen, and executed upon the Houſes of the Earl of Callendar, the Lord Cardroſs, the Lady Lumſden, &c. and it was again attempted in the Year 1678, upon the Houſes belonging to the Lairds of Cheſnock, Blaghan and Rowallane, and they were poſſeſſed by Souldiers and declared Garriſons: Nor did it reſt here, but your Conſpirators ſent Orders, and required the Countries about thoſe Houſes, to furniſh them for the uſe of your Souldiers, and to ſupply them with Neceſſaries, contrary to the Laws of that Kingdom: It was againſt this, that Sir Patrick Hume, now a Peer of Scotland, applied himſelf to the Conſpirators to have Redreſs; and common Juſtice being denied him, he uſed a legal Proteſtation in the ordinary Form of the Law of that Kingdom, and was thereupon kept many Months in Priſon, and declared uncapable of all Publick Truſts.\n               5. I muſt put you in mind how you by your Conſpirators endeavoured to kindle a Flame amongſt the Scotch; for ſince you had diſobliged ſo many of them, and had begot ſuch a Diſaffection in them againſt you and your Brother; your great Deſign was to keep that Diſaffection alive, and not only ſo, but ſo to increaſe it, as to make them riſe and take up Arms in their own defence; therefore in order to this in the Year 1677, April 19. the Letters of your Conſpiring Jeſuits, to the Procurator-General at Madrid, gave him notice, that your Conſpirators at London, the Fathers of the Society, had ſent for Scotland, three Jeſuits in Maſquerade to give the poor provoked Scots to underſtand theſe three things: 1. That all the Miſeries, under which they groaned, was from the Biſhops and their Clergy, which Doctrine they were inclined enough to believe, they naturally hating the Government of the Church by that ſort of Men, as being againſt the expreſs Word of God, and tending to Tyranny. 2. That there was no other way to recover their Liberty and Religion, but by the Sword; and this was certainly true, for they had made all the humble Applications that could be made by Men, both to the King your Brother and the Council in Scotland, and could find no Redreſs of their Grievances; for as theſe Villains were ſent to exaſperate them on the one hand, ſo you and your Traitor Lauderdale augmented their Miſeries on the other hand, and all in Order to make them take up Arms in their own Defence. 3. That the King your Brother was ſo addicted to his Pleaſure, that he neither would nor could take care in that Concern, but left them to be redreſſed by thoſe that cruelly oppreſſed them; which was as notoriouſly true: and you wanted not your wicked Inſtruments to accompliſh the great Deſign you had in hand, of enſlaving the\nProteſtants of that Kingdom, ſo that the Method you took, by your Jeſuits, by their Inſinuations, and by your Task-maſters to oppreſs them, you did very much incline them, to take up Arms againſt your Conſpirators in their own Defence.\n               Sir, Your Jeſuits in Scotland laid not aſide their Attempts there, to make the diſtreſſed Proteſtants riſe; for the whole Popiſh Party was at Work to ſtir up the Commotion, by them deſigned, in that Kingdom, as appears by Letters from thence, from your Incendiaries, of the 11th. of Auguſt, 1678. Nay, that the Work might take effect, Eight thouſand Scots that were of the Romiſh Religion ſhould be ready, For what? to join with the diſaffected Scots: Such Sots you employed, as if the diſaffected Scots would join with them. But the Truth of it was, to Pillage and Deſtroy the Habitations of thoſe that ſhould riſe in the Defence of their Lives, Liberties, and Religion; for that was the Intent, whatever Imaginations your Cut-throat Jeſuites had in their empty Noddles, that appears in their Pacquet of Auguſt the 10th. 1678. directed to John Grove: For you muſt remember that was your Deſign, and Lauderdale's, tho' your Jeſuites thought, that the poor Proteſtants might be brought to join with the Popiſh Party, to make a Commotion there: for when your Secretary peruſed the Contents, he laughed at the Folly of the Scotch Jeſuites, but ſaid, If the Scotch would riſe, he cared not with whom they joined; for their Riſing was the thing that was deſired.\nYour Deſign had its effect; for their Provocations were ſo many, and their Oppreſſion ſo great from Lauderdale, and his wicked Party, who were ſerving your Brother's, and your Popiſh Deſigns, to bring that People under a deſpotick Power, and the Inſolencies of your impudent Clergy was ſuch, that they could no longer bear; and therefore in the Year 1679. they did raiſe Forces, and armed them; and by their Declaration they were far from carrying on a Popiſh Deſign; for their Deſign was the Extirpation of Popery, and Popiſh Prelacy, out of Scotland, which had been a great Grievance to that Kingdom. And becauſe, Sir, you may have forgotten their Declaration, I will give it Word for Word, and is as follows:\n\nAS it is not unknown to a great Part of the World, how Happy the Church of Scotland was whilſt they enjoyed the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt in Purity and Power, of which we have been deplorably deprived, by the Reeſtabliſhment of Prelacy; ſo it is evident, not only to impartial Perſons, but to profeſſed Enemies, with what unparalell'd Patience and Conſtancy the People of God have endured all the Cruelty, Injuſtice, and Oppreſſion, that the Will and Malice of Prelacy and Malignants could invent, and exerciſe. And being moſt unwilling to act any thing which might import Oppoſition to lawful Authority, or engage the Kingdoms in War, although we have been all along groaning under the Over-turning the Work of Reformation, Corruptions of Doctrine, Slighting of Worſhip, Deſpiſing of Ordinances, the Changing the Ancient\nChurch-Diſcipline and Government, Thruſting out ſo many of our Faithful Miniſters from their Charges, Confining ſtraightly, Impriſoning, Exileing, yea, and putting to Death many of them, and Intruding upon their Flocks a Company of Inſufficient Scandalous Perſons, Confining, Impriſoning, Torturing, Tormenting, Scourging, and Stigmatizing Poor People, Plundering their Goods, Quartering upon them Rude Soldiers, Selling their Perſons to Foreign Plantations, Horning and Intercommuning many of both Sexes, whereby great Numbers, in every corner of the Land, were forced to leave their Dwellings, Wives, Children, and Relations, and made to wander as Pilgrims, ſtill in Hazard of their Lives, none daring to Recet, Harbour, or Supply, (though Starving;) or ſo much as to ſpeak to them, though upon Death-bed, without making themſelves obnoxious to the ſame Puniſhments. And theſe things acted under colour of Law, in effect tending to baniſh not only all Senſe of Religion, but alſo to extinguiſh all natural Affection, even amongſt Perſons of neareſt Relations, and likewiſe groaning under the intolerable Yoak of Oppreſſion in our Civil Intereſt, our Bodies, Liberties, and Eſtates; ſo that all manner of Outrages have been moſt arbitrarily exerciſed upon us, for a Tract of ſeveral Years paſt, particularly in the Year 1678. by ſending us an armed Hoſt of Barbarous Savages, contrary to all Law, and Humanity; and by laying on us ſeveral Impoſitions, and Taxes, as formerly, ſo of late, by a Meeting of Prelimited and Over-awed Members in the Convention of Eſtates in July, 1678. for keeping up of an armed Force, intruſted (as to a great part of it) into the Hands of avowed Papiſts, or Favourers of them, by whom ſundry Invaſions have been made upon us, and moſt exorbitant Abuſes, and incredible Inſolencies committed againſt us; and we being continually ſought after, while meeting in Houſes for Divine Worſhip, Miniſters and People frequently apprehended, and moſt rigorouſly uſed; and ſo being neceſſitated to attend the Lord's Ordinances in the Fields, in the moſt deſert Places; and there alſo often hunted out, and aſſaulted, to the effuſion of our Blood, and killing of ſome, whereby we were inveitably conſtrain'd either to defend our ſelves by Arms at thoſe Meetings, or be altogether deprived of the Goſpel preached by Faithful Miniſters, and made abſolute Slaves: At one of which Meetings, upon the Firſt Day of June inſtant, being the Lord's Day, Captain Graham, of Claverhouſe, being warranted by a late Proclamation to kill whomſoever he found in Arms at Field-Conventicles making Reſiſtance, did furiouſly aſſault the People aſſembled; and further, to provoke, did cruelly bind, like Beaſts, a Miniſter, with ſome others whom he had found that ſame Morning in Houſes; and ſeveral being killed on both ſides, they knowing certainly that by Law they behoved (if apprehended) to dye, they did ſtand to their own defence, and continue together; and there, after many of our Friends and Countrymen being under the ſame Oppreſſion, expecting the ſame meaſure, did freely offer their Aſſiſtance. We therefore thus inevitably, and of abſolute Neceſſity, forced to take this laſt Remedy, (tho Magiſtrates having ſhut the Door by a Law againſt Application, that whatever our Grievances be, either\nin things Civil or Sacred, we have not the Privilege of a Supplicant) do judge our ſelves bound to dcelare, That theſe, with many other horrid Grievances, in Church and State, (which we purpoſe to manifeſt more fully hereafter) are the true Cauſes of this our Lawful and Innocent Self-defence: And we moſt ſolemnly, and in the preſence of Almighty God, the Searcher of all Hearts, declare, that the true Reaſons of our continuing in Arms, candidly and ſincerely, are theſe:\n\n\nFirſt, The defending and ſecuring of the true Proteſtant Religion, and Preſbyterian Government founded upon the Word of God, and ſummarily comprehended in our Confeſſions of Faith and Catechiſm, and eſtabliſhed by the Laws of this Land, to which King, Nobles, and People are ſolemnly ſworn and engaged in our National Solemn League and Covenant; and more particularly the Defending and Maintaining the Kingly Authority of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt over his Church, against all ſinful Supremacy derogatory thereto, and incroaching thereupon.\n\n\n\nSecond, The preſerving and defending the King's Majeſty, his Perſon and Authority in the Preſervation and Defence of that true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom, that the World may bear Witneſs with our Conſciences, of our Loyalty; and that we have no Thoughts nor Intention to diminiſh his just Power and Greatneſs.\n\n\n\nThird, The Obtaining of a Free and United Parliament, and a Free and General Aſſembly in Order to the Redreſſing of our foreſaid Grievances for the preventing the eminent Danger of Popery, and extirpating Prelacy from amongſt us.\n\n\n\nThis therefore being the Cauſe we appear for, and reſolve, in God's Name, to own, hereby homologating all the Teſtimonies of faithful Sufferers for the Truth in Scotland theſe eighteen Years by gone. We humbly requeſt the King's Majeſty to reſtore all things as he found them when God brought him home to his Crown and Kingdoms; and if that cannot be obtained, then we heartily and humbly invite and intreat, beſeech and obteſt, by the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, all who are under the ſame Bonds with us, to occur in this Common Cauſe and Intereſt; and that they will not ſtand ſtill and ſee not only us oppreſſed but this foreſaid Cauſe ruined, Adverſaries proudly and highly inſult againſt God and all good Men, Friends of the Truth diſcouraged, yea, the Proteſtant Cauſe in Britain and Ireland, and even your ſelves within a little time made a Prey of, or elſe forced, when we are broken, (which the good Lord prevent) dreadfully to wrong your Conſciences. Finally, becauſe we deſire no Man's hurt or blood, we requeſt our Country-men, now the ſtanding Forces of this Kingdom, ſome\nof them being our Friends and Kinſmen, not to fight againſt us, leaſt in ſo doing they be found fighting againſt the Lord, whoſe Cauſe and Quarrel we are ſure he will own and ſignally countenance, ſeeing we fight under his Banner who is the Lord of Hoſts.\n\nThis, Sir, you know, was the Declaration of theſe Bleſſed Servants of God, but you had not filled up the meaſure of your Sins, and therefore God was pleaſed to deliver theſe miſerably enſlaved wretches into your hands, and they were made a prey to your never to be forgotten Cut-throats; and ſome of them ſealed their Teſtimony of Jeſus with their Blood: You may remember what Havock your Popiſh Crew made of them both in their Eſtates and Families, that Scotland was a Field of Blood, through many Barbarous Murders that you by the Hands of your Party Committed there.\nSome of your bloody Crew here, eſpecially the Tyrant Lauderdale, were exceeding glad of the News of theſe poor Proteſtants Riſing, and your Popiſh Conſpirators and their Motly Proteſtant Admirers and Abettors did prick up their Ears at the News, and concluded the Day was their own. Our Engliſh Popiſh Army was to cut their Throats firſt, and then the Throats of all Engliſh Men that ſtood in their Way afterwards. And Lauderdale highly valued himſelf upon this Riſing (for Poſts came every day to White-hall to bring the News of their Increaſing) boaſting that now the Fanaticks had ſhewed themſelves in their Colours; and that it was by that ſtrict hand that he had kept over them in Scotland that had been the Cauſe of their being quiet ſo long, hoping by this to get Honour for his prudent Management, when all Mankind knows that his Management was with a Deſign to make them take up Arms: And it was you and he that raiſed that Devil; but, Sir, you know whom you had appointed to betray them. Sir, you were in Flanders, thither the News was ſent to you, not becauſe you were ignorant of the Contrivance; but it was a Watch-word for your Return: But that you might lay this Devil, which you and your Conſpirators had raiſed, and kill two Birds with one Stone; therefore you pitch'd upon the Duke of Monmouth, that he might deſtroy the Proteſtants there, and that his Perſon might either fall in Scotland, or his Reputation be ruined here at home; therefore by your Advice or rather Direction, he is ordered for Scotland in all haſt, for it was the Grief of your Soul to ſee him the Darling of the Proteſtants of both Kingdoms. Beſides, Sir, you knew, that if he went Armed into Scotland, without Aſſent of Parliament in both Kingdoms, by an Act made in the Reign of Charles the F\n•\nſt, was High Treaſon and therefore the Conſequences might be fatal to him every way.\nHowever he went by the general Conſent of the Council, and was well received in Scotland, by Vertue of his Commiſſion given him, and draws the Army in Scotland together and faces theſe poor Wretches; and indeed, as Matters had been managed in Scotland, it was a great Queſtion if the Forces\nin Scotland would have been prevailed with, with ſo little Difficulty to be commanded to go out againſt theſe innocent and oppreſſed Country-men of theirs, had it not been to go under the Command of the Duke of Monmouth, who marches up to the Enemy, they by their Petition deſire Liberty of Religion, and offer to lay down their Arms; it being given out by your Party, that the Duke of Monmouth had a Power of giving them Terms, but that could not be done by him, for your Blood-hounds never intended they ſhould have any Quarter given them, therefore he had not that Power in his Commiſſion, of granting any Terms as was promiſed him: Nay, if I am not miſtaken, after that he had left London, the Inſtructions that he had to grant Terms were recalled before ever he arrived in Scotland; ſo that ſome of our Counſellors intended well, and though all things were promiſed not long before to be acted before their Faces above-board, yet they were miſtaken; for all the chief of their Conſults were privately acted amongſt your Popiſh Crew, the French Ambaſſador, and your Prieſts, at the Ducheſs of Portſmouth's Lodgings; and to give them a Reputation, the honeſt Part of the Council ſitting as Cyphers, all was done as by an Order of the King and Council.\n               Well, what then? The Duke of Monmouth engaged with theſe poor Creatures, but your Rogues, and Trickers, and Officers amongſt theſe poor Souls, ſoon left them, before the Battle was begun; ſo that the Pains of Reducing them was not very great nor hazardous, and divers of theſe poor Proteſtants were murdered upon the place by one Oglethorpe, an eminent Cut-throat, yet alive, notwithſtanding they cried for Quarter, which was promiſed them; but how well that Promiſe was kept, was ſeen; many hundreds of them having been murdered in cool Blood, under a Colour of Law as if they had been Traytors: So that the Duke comes home a Victor in the ſence of ſome, and a vanquiſhed Perſon in the minds and affections of others, who would not, out of Love to him, have had him engaged with ſuch an ill Company of Cut-throats in ſuch a thing in Scotland, they knowing it hazardous in many Reſpects; however, for his own Security, he procured his Pardon for that Action. But that Pardon though it was an Act of great foreſight in the Duke, yet the Judgment of Heaven purſued him; for as he contributed to the Murder of ſo many poor Proteſtants by the Help of Popiſh Cut-throats, ſo he himſelf was murdered, and his Friends, by you and your Popiſh Cut-throats\nIt will not be amiſs, Sir, to put you in mind of your Cut-throat Lauderdale, of whom you made ſuch uſe and who complied againſt his Underſtanding, Judgment and Conſcience (if he had any) with you and your Brother in all thoſe Villainous Acts and Barbarous Inhumanities in Scotland. I will now ſhew the Opinion that our Engliſh Parliament had of that Monſter of Mankind.\n\n1. Remember, Sir, the Addreſs of the Houſe of Commons to the King your Brother, on April 23. 1675. for then they found that ſome perſons in great Employment under that King had fomented Deſigns againſt the Intereſt of the Subject, intending to deprive Great Britain of its ancient Rights and Liberties, that thereby they might the more eaſily introduce the Popiſh Religion and Arbitrary Government, to the ruine and deſtruction of the Subjects thereof, amongſt whom they had juſt cauſe to accuſe, for a promoter of ſuch Deſigns, the Duke of Lauderdale, becauſe it had been teſtified in their Houſe by ſeveral Members of Parliament, That in a Hearing before the Council, in the Caſe of Mr. Pennyſtone Whalley, who had committed Mr. John James contrary to the King's Declaration of the 15th of March 1671, the ſaid Duke of Lauderdale did publickly affirm, in the preſence of the King your Brother, and before ſeveral then attending the Board, that the King's Edicts were to be obey'd, for that they were equal with the Laws, and ought to be obſerv'd; in the firſt place thereby juſtifying the ſaid Declaration, and the Proceedings thereupon, and declaring his Inclination to Arbitrary Councels, in terror of all good Proteſtants. This, Sir, was not all, but they had a farther confirmation of this Opinion by two Acts of Parliament, of a very ſtrange and dangerous nature, which they had found in the printed Statutes of Scotland, the firſt whereof was in the third Seſſion of the firſt Parliament held under the King your Brother, Cap. 25. and the other in a ſecond Parliament, Cap. 2. the like had never paſſed ſince the union of the two Crowns, and were contrary to an Act paſſed in the fourth year of the Reign of James the Firſt, your Grandfather, which intended the better abolition of all memory of Hoſtility, and the dependencies thereof between England and Scotland, and the better repreſſing the Occaſions of Diſcord and Diſorders for time to come; and of a like Act paſſed about the ſame time in Scotland; by the force of which ſaid late Acts there was a Militia ſetled in that Kingdom of Twenty thouſand Foot and Two thouſand Horſe, who were obliged to be in a readineſs to march into any part of the Kingdom of England, for any ſervice wherein your Brother's Honour and Greatneſs might be concerned; and they were to obey ſuch Orders and Directions as they ſhould from time to time receive from the Privy Council of that Kingdom: By colour of which general words the then Parliament did conceive that the Kingdom of England was liable to be invaded upon any pretence whatſoever. And this was done by the procurement of that Lauderdale, he having been all the time of thoſe Tranſactions Principal Secretary of that Kingdom, and chiefly intruſted with the adminiſtration of the Affairs of State there, and he being Commiſſioner for holding the Parliament at the time of paſſing the latter of the ſaid Acts, whereby the providing the ſaid Horſe and Foot was effectually impoſed upon that Kingdom, and that extraordinary Power veſted in the Privy Council there; ſo that the Commons of England conceived they had juſt reaſon to apprehend the ill Conſequences of ſo great and an unuſal Power, eſpecially ſince at that time the Affairs of the Kingdom of Scotland were managed by the ſaid Duke, who publiſh'd himſelf to be a Perſon of ſuch pernicious Principles; thereupon they pray'd the King your Brother to diſmiſs him from all his Employments, and forbid\nhim his Preſence and Counſels for ever, as a perſon obnoxious and dangerous to the Government.\n               This, Sir, is the Character, and theſe are the Qualifications of a perſon that your Conſpirators judg'd meet for a man to ſerve your Cauſe and Intereſt; and how near he brought the People of Scotland to the French Government and Intereſt, I muſt leave an impartial Reader to judge; he wanted nothing but a King to make an Example of him and all ſuch profligate Monſters of Mankind. But I will give you a ſecond Inſtance of the good Opinion that the Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament had of this Varlet; and that is as follows.\n2. Upon the 10th of May, 1678, the Commons of England aſſembled in that Parliament repreſented to the King your Brother, the deplorable condition the ſtate of the Kingdom, thro' evil Counſellors, which, Sir, you know were your Conſpirators, and were deſigning to overthrow the Proteſtant Intereſt in both Kingdoms, and were the Cauſe why the King your Brother follow'd not the Advice of his Parliament for the redreſſing of Grievances, amongſt whom they reckon'd John Duke of Lauderdale, and pray'd that the King would remove him from his Council and Preſence for ever.\n3. I haſten to a third Inſtance of the Opinion that the Commons of England had of the ſaid Duke of Lauderdale; and that was in a Parliament held in May 10th, 1679. They tell the King in their Addreſs, That they found the Kingdoms involv'd in imminent dangers and great difficulties by the evil deſigns and pernicious Counſels of ſome who had been, and were then, actually in high Places of Truſt and Authority about the Perſon of the then King, who, contrary to the Duty of their Places, by their arbitrary and deſtructive Counſels, tending to the ſubverſion of the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of the People of Great Britain, and the alteration of the Proteſtant Religion, did endeavour to alienate the Hearts of the People from the then King and his Government, amongſt whom they had juſt reaſon to accuſe the Duke of Lauderdale for a chief promoter of ſuch Counſels, and more particularly for contriving and endeavouring to raiſe Jealouſies and Miſunderſtandings between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, whereby Hoſtilities might have enſued, and might have riſen between the two Nations. They took notice of the many repeated Addreſſes of the immediate preceding Parliament; and were much concerned that notwithſtanding thoſe Addreſſes they found that Duke Lauderdale, with all his Qualifications, continued in the Councils of the then King, for that the Affairs of the Kingdom required that none ſhould be put into ſuch Employments but ſuch as were not only of known Abilities, Intereſt and Eſteem in the Nation, but alſo were without all ſuſpicion of miſtaking or betraying the true Intereſt of the Nation. Upon theſe Conſiderations a new Parliament pray'd the then King to remove him the ſaid Duke Lauderdale from his Employments, and Perſon, and Councels for ever.\nYou well know, that in the Month of February 1678, you were baniſh'd into Flanders, before the meeting of the new Parliament, (for the good King your Brother parted with his old Penſioners, who lowed very loud for want of Fodder, and to ſave Charges, that ſtale Parliament was diſſolv'd and a new one\ncall'd) whom your Conſpirators, by the inſight they had in the Elections, knew it would be ſuch a Parliament as was not for their turns; therefore a deep Conſult was held, how to make the Nation to believe that they were in earneſt; they reſolv'd to diſcover the Plot, and diſcourage Popery, tho' in truth it was the two things you and your Conſpirators aimed at to be ſtill ſupported. However, to blind the Eyes of Mankind, it was reſolved that all imaginable ſymptoms ſhould be publickly profeſſed, both for the diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and leaving you and your Conſpirators, for you were to abſent your ſelf from your Brother, and go beyond Sea for ſome time, upon theſe Conſiderations; the one was, That you being out of the way, might ſtop the further examination of the Popiſh Plot, then newly diſcover'd to the King, who was in every bit of it but that of his own Life; and it had a near relation to your ſelf: And by this means your Conſpirators thought to preſerve the Chief Conſpirator alive and ſafe. The other was for a gloſs, to make Mankind to think that the King your Brother and the Court were ſuch mortal Enemies to Popery, that he would not endure you his Popiſh Brother near him, for fear of being influenc'd by Popiſh Councels. But, Sir, you may remember, that your ſelf and Conſpirators at St. James's were of a different Opinion, ſome of your Partiſans with all their might and skill oppoſed your leaving the Kingdom, for that it would weaken your Party extreamly, and make perſons more bold to come in and give Evidence againſt you when you were abſent than if you were preſent, and that if you were abſent, tho' by the Royal Command of your Brother the King, yet the People would be ready enough to ſay you fl\n•\nd for fear, and that it was in effect to own your ſelf guilty. Such Arguments as theſe were uſed by your Conſpirators, but the Whore Portſmouth carry'd it for your going; therefore a Command was ſent to you all of a ſudden, That it was your Brother's pleaſure you ſhould be gone.\n               This, Sir, fill'd many with amazement, who knew not for what ends ſuch Counſels had been taken; and it filled others with great Joy, they now believing that the King your Brother, and his Court, would have been purg'd from Popery and his Popiſh Councels, and the Popiſh Fabrick, which had been ſo long a building, would again tumble down, when they ſaw you that were the chief ſupporter of it had left your ſtation.\nWell, Sir, away you go for Flanders, as if you had been going into another World; but your Conſpirators were not a whit daunted, but reſolv'd to ſtick as faithfully to you as you had done before to them. And tho' by this departure of yours many of your Conſpirators, for whom the Kingdoms were too hot, and who ought to have danced a Gambrel at Tyburn, under the pretence of being your Servants, yet notwithſtanding, the hardieſt and boldeſt of your impudent Crew ſtaid behind, and watch'd Affairs at home, letting nothing be done that was material but what was done by your Advice and Direction and theirs; and by your being abroad, they had the opportunity of ſtudying and adviſing what was fit to be done at home.\nThis, Sir, I muſt obſerve to you by the way, that before you could be prevail'd upon to go, you were faithfully promiſed, that nothing of value or moment\nſhould be done or acted without you; nay, the Speech that was to be made at the Opening of the Parliament was concluded on before you went: Yet for all this, at the Meeting of the New Parliament, which was now become almoſt a Wonder in this Nation, a great panick Fear was ſtruck in all or moſt of your Crew, and they certainly had ſo much Fear upon them, from the leaſt to the greateſt, that they were even ready to cry Quarter, or at leaſt to offer terms of accommodation, the Nation being in a very great ferment; and your Party, that had rely'd ſo much upon the mighty Mind of the French King for Mony, began to curſe him for driving them upon theſe Extremities; nay, you your ſelf did not ſpare to revile him for the ſame.\n               The King your Brother happening to be indiſpos'd at Windſor, which being poſted over to you, you return with all ſpeed, and unexpectedly; and being here, you had but a little inclination to return to Flanders again; but the King pleaſing you with ſome private Reſolutions of his, you did ſubmit to return again to Flanders, where you was as coldly received as at firſt; but your ſtay was not long there, for the Coaſt being then clear, you reſolved upon returning home, and did accordingly return; and the deſign, you know, was then to fix the Sham Proteſtant Plot you and your Conſpirators had contriv'd: But that would not keep you in England, for it was reſolv'd that you ſhould go to Scotland, to ſettle the Proteſtant Religion there, where you receiv'd the ſad News of the baffling the Sham-Plot that you and yours had thought to charge upon ſome Proteſtants, which made you take new Meaſures, and you reſolv'd to part with a ſmall ſpell of Mony to get the Parliament prorogued for ſome longer time, and a greater Sum was preſſed from France, but without ſucceſs; for the Duke of Bucks ſpoil'd that Deſign, for which piece of ſervice you owed him a Cake, and was reſolv'd, if it had not been timely prevented, you would have beſtow'd upon him a whole Loaf. But that by the way.\nWell, you arrive in Scotland, I pray how were you receiv'd? with great Joy to your Banditti there: Nay, the moſt excellent Proteſtant Biſhops receiv'd you with tokens of Welcome, and highly reſented the Affront that the Parliament of England had put upon you, when they went about to exclude you, and very honeſtly declar'd againſt it; and tho' the Commons of England were ſo dim ſighted, as not to ſee that the only way to ſettle the Proteſtant Religion was by a Popiſh King, yet they could ſee it, and declare it as an undoubted Truth. Now, Sir, it was expected that you ſhould admire the Fabrick that your old Friend Lauderdale had ſo delicately contrived, and in reward of his good Service advance his Intereſt: No, no, you no ſooner got into Scotland, but you were deſigning againſt Lauderdale, he being the great Inſtrument of ſending you thither, for you never forgave him that Affront; ſo that after your arrival in Scotland his Intereſt much dwindl'd away. Thus you rewarded one of your old Friends, who had ſold Body and Soul and all to the Devil to ſerve you and your Cauſe; he is gone to his place, I fear, in ſure and certain expectation of Wrath and Vengeance, for the many Villanies he had committed againſt the Religion, Laws and Liberties of his Country.\n\nWhilſt, Sir, you were in Scotland, you and your Conſpirators made your Deſigns to go on to your full content, tho' much diligence was us'd and pains were taken in the point: and to give you and your Accomplices that which is your due, you never did ſpare your Pains for the bringing on your wicked Devices to perfection; and you thought it good Policy and your beſt way to make ſure of ſomething, that if England ſhould be too hard for you, yet you reſolved to make ſure of Scotland: And, to repeal thoſe Laws that were in force, which did debar a Popiſh Prince from inheriting that Crown, therefore you got a Parliament call'd, and your ſelf made High Commiſſioner. Upon this you labour the Point, for the choice of the Commoners that ſhould be fit for the purpoſe; and to cajole ſome of the Lords, you entice Hamilton to come into your Intereſt. You mounted the Throne as High Commiſſioner, without regarding the Law, or due Qualifications neceſſary in taking the Oaths, for that was below you: And the King having furniſh'd you with Letters, you are admitted into the Council without taking the Oaths: But being got into the Houſe, you carried all before you, and got your Succeſſion to the Crown of Scotland ſecured by an Act; and you got a Teſt paſſed, by which all were to ſwear not to endeavour to alter that Government either in Church or State; and all ſuch as refuſed were to loſe their Employments. In a word, you made every thing to paſs that you and your Crew had a mind to.\n               As you were a Privy Councillor in that Kingdom, you wheedled in the Duke of Hamilton, and admitted him one of the Council, who was very zealous for the Proteſtant Religion formerly, but then began to be very cool: And ſo were the reſt of the cajoled Lords, they all put on the Temper that Scotchmen uſually are attended withal, that is, to be falſe to the Cauſe that is perſecuted; for, upon the riſing of the Parliament, they ſuffer'd the poor Diſſenters to be ſqueezed to death, and ſuffer'd all imaginable Severities to be uſed towards them. You ſucceeding ſo well in Parliament, you uſed great Endeavours for a ſtanding Army, under the notion of ſecuring the Peace againſt thoſe Diſſenters and Field Meeters; but tho' you had labour'd hard in that point, yet the Succeſs did not anſwer your expectation ſo fully as to give you content.\nWell, Sir, what becomes of old Lauderdale, your faithful Servant and dearly beloved Favorite, for I do not find him in this Parliament? No, he's forced to ſtay in England, not daring to appear in Scotland, for his Hell hounds were not able to weather the Point, becauſe the Stream run ſo ſtrong againſt him (not that you had made any change of his Meaſures in the Conſpiracy againſt the Proteſtant Intereſt and Religion, unleſs it were for the worſe); and very deſirous you were of getting him into Scotland, and no doubt you would have ſerved him a Scotch Maiden Trick: Why ſo? Becauſe that Old Dog had been heard to ſay, that all you had done in Scotland was nothing, in regard the Oaths were omitted; and, that the Parliament was but a Convention and what you had done was in it ſelf void, and of no effect. Theſe were bloody words, and highly reſented by you; and afterwards you had an Eye upon Argyle, who began to ſnort at the Teſt; and though he had been a Dog in a String to your Brother and your ſelf, ſome Qualm came croſs his Conſcience: He therefore began\nto make his Interpretations upon it, which were ſuch as cut the Throat of the thing it ſelf: And altho' the Interpretation he gave could be no other than the genuine ſence of the thing, and plain to be underſtood, that it could mean no other than what he intended to take it in, yet it was ſo much diſliked, that he was then to have been made a Sacrifice, under the notion of being guilty of High Treaſon, only for explaining the Teſt; he was accordingly ſeized and libelled againſt, and found guilty of the Fact, and he was then in a fair way to have loſt his Life for his Ingenuity, but he, with a great deal of dexterity, made his eſcape, and ſo ſaved himſelf for that time from being murder'd by you and your Cut-throats there.\n               \nScotland, Sir, you bridled and ſaddled, and brought the Government there to be ſomething like the French Mode, differing nothing but that you had made the Scots the greater Vaſſals of the two: And the People of that Kingdom careſſed you highly for the grace and favour of their Vaſſalage, notwithſtanding which, you were not willing to ſtay any longer there, your Friends adviſing you by all means to return to England, to ſecure your Intereſt in England, you having ſetled Scotland to your content. And this remember, Sweet Sir, that the Whore Portſmouth, with her Baſtard Son, was by your Royal Brother ſent to France, to renew the Dover Treaty, in which ſhe was more ſucceſsful than your Siſter of bleſſed memory, for ſhe was careſſed by the French King, and her Baſtard honour'd as a Prince of the Blood, and ſhe ſetled a firm Correſpondency between Lewis of France and Charles of Great Britain, purſuant to the Treaty at Dover. This you heard of, and you judged the Strumpet was undermining you, and obtaining the Succeſſion for her ſon, which made you after your arrival at Whitehall more unwilling to return again for Scotland than before; and you preſſed the then King your Brother for your ſtay here; but you were told, that you muſt return to Scotland, where your ſtay ſhould be but ſhort; you obeyed, and went by Sea, with your chief Favourite Mumper, who with you was like to have been loſt, but you ſaved your ſelf and the Curr, and loſt ſome Treaſure, with a great part of your Retinue, who drank your Health, and went to the bottom. But you arrive in Scotland, and the Mony being loſt, your Intentions of having a ſtanding Army there were ſunk alſo.\nYour ſtay was to be ſhort in Scotland, and ſo ſhall mine; therefore ſince I have put you in mind of your bridling and ſaddling that poor Kingdom, as a Subject and a High Commiſſioner for King Charles, give me leave to remember you of your Carriage when you pretended to and uſurped that Crown as King of S\n•\notland, for by the Laws of that Kingdom all Popiſh Princes were uncapable of that Crown: And becauſe of your Omiſſion of the Oaths that were to be by you taken, all that you did in repealing them was null and void, and to no effect; ſo that thoſe Laws were ſtill in force againſt you, notwithſtanding the aforeſaid pretended Repeal; for without thoſe Oaths the meeting together of Lords and Commons was no Parliament, but a Convention, which cannot repeal any Statute there. Upon your taking that Crown, the Earl of Argyle, upon the 20th of May 1685, well knowing how the Proteſtant Religion muſt ſuffer in Scotland, lands in Scotland near a place called Kentire, and on the 21ſt ſent forth his Declaration,\nwherein he tells the Scots, That the End of his coming was the defence of the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws and Liberties of the Proteſtants of Scotland againſt Popery and Arbitrary Government, and therefore he required all perſons from ſixteen to ſixty to come and joyn with him, with Arms and Proviſions neceſſary. One of his ſons ſent Letters to ſeveral Gentlemen upon the ſame account, ſo that in few days his Army was encreaſed to 2500 Men. But, Sir, your Trappan that betray'd the poor Proteſtants at Bothw\n•\nll bridge, 1679, eſcaping the Gallows, lived to betray this poor Gentleman, in the year 1685. for, inſtead of ſhewing him the true way wherein he ſhould have marched, provided Rogues who led him into a bogg, from whence he returning towards Glyde, was fallen upon by ſome Scots, and taken; and, Sir, by your Arbitrary Order he was baſely murder'd at Edinburgh on the 30th of June following.\n               This man had all along fought in your Brother's Cauſe and Quarrel, and was an Inſtrument to betray his Father to your Brother, and was murder'd in the beginning of his Reign after his Return. This man had ſerved your Cauſe and Intereſt in Scotland many years, and had run in the ſame exceſs of Riot with your Conſpirators, but God opened his Eyes to ſee your baſe Deſigns againſt the Religion and Liberties of his Country, and therefore nothing would ſatisfie you but his Blood, and the ruine of his whole Family. Well, he is dead, but I muſt ſay of him, he deſerved better Fortune in the World, and more Favour from your Hands and his that is gone to his place.\n\nScotland did another time become a Field of Blood; and till it was, you were not contented. But the Scots being weary of theſe perpetual diſappointments, they ſubmitted to your Government, and you then declared, by the Advice of your Villanous Conſpirators, eſpecially the damn'd Biſhops, that you were clothed with an Abſolute Power, and that all your Subjects of that Kingdom were bound to obey you without reſerve; upon which you did aſſume an Arbitrary Power both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom: From all which it's apparent, what you did when you were Duke of York was in order to compleat the Work when you came to be King James.\n\nTheſe great and inſufferable Oppreſſions of the poor Proteſtants of that Kingdom, and the open contempt of all Law, Juſtice, Sence, and Reaſon, together with the ſad Conſequences that moſt certainly followed upon it, did put thoſe poor People under great and juſt Fears, and did thrice make them offer at ſuch lawful Remedies as were Allow'd by the very Law of Nature, tho' it was not with that effect that was deſir'd, Lauderdale and your other Conſpirators did endeavour to make all men to apprehend the loſs of their Lives, Liberties Honours, and Eſtates, if they ſhould go about to preſerve themſelves from your great Oppreſſions by Petitions, Remonſtrances, or other means the Law did allow of: So you did by ſeveral Scotch Noblemen and Gentlemen, to their utter ruine; therefore what Obligation you have laid upon the Kingdom in general, or any one Proteſtant in particular, both before and ſince your pretended Reign there, I leave it to your ſelf and Conſpirators to judge: And therefore bleſſed be God for delivering that Nation from your Tyranny and Oppreſſion.\n\n\n               IV. ENGLAND.\n               NOW we have ſeen your particular Projects that you and your Conſpirators purſued to ruine Holland, Ireland, and Scotland, I think it will not be unneceſſary to put you in mind of the Pranks you and your Party play'd both before and ſince you uſurped the Imperial Crown of this Kingdom, and then you will ſee whether you can expect that any honeſt Engliſhman ſhould ever engage for your return again in Peace to this Nation. Therefore I ſhall uſe this method: 1. I ſhall ſhew you how far you were engag'd in the Conſpiracy of turning the Civil Government into downright French Slavery, and our Proteſtant Religion into Popery, before you took the Crown. And, 2. I ſhall ſhew you what you contributed to it after. 3. I will ſhew you the unreaſonableneſs of the attempting your return hither: On which Particulars, I hope, you have leiſure enough to reflect, and adviſe about with your worthy Miniſtry you have attending your perſon at St. Germains.\n\nI. I will ſhew you how far you were engaged in the Conſpiracy of turning the Civil Government into downright French Slavery, and our Proteſtant Religion into Popery, before you took the Crown. When God was pleaſed to reſtore you and your Brothers, you may remember that you came into a Land flowing with Milk and Hony, for its Plenty, and a well-govern'd Country, for Religion and Virtue. But this agreed not with the Complexion of your Souls, you had another Game to play, and this I found in a Letter of yours from Breda to old Courtney the Jeſuite, That you would follow the Directions that Mazarine had given you, and then you queſtion'd not but to bring the People to receive the Roman Catholick Religion. This, Sir, was your Project, and how you purſued it, let all the World judge. Therefore,\n1. Your Conſpirators were reſolv'd to remove all thoſe who had been eminent in Virtue and Sobriety from any Command or Place of Truſt in the Government. I muſt not forget the Uſage of thoſe who had been great Inſtruments in that Work, viz. Two thouſand Miniſters in one day laid aſide, that room might be made for thoſe whoſe Doctrine ſhould enſlave the People, and whoſe profligate Lives ſhould render Men Atheiſts enough to be of any Religion but of that which was according to Godlineſs; Make them Atheiſts, ſaid Mazarine, aad you will ſoon make them Papiſts. Nay, the love of Debauchery created ſuch a Prejudice in your Brother the King, againſt the Marquiſs of Argyle, that it was the chief Obſtacle to his being pardon'd, for he had reprov'd Charles for offering Violence to a ſober Lady in Scotland, in the year 1650, for which Reproof he never forgave Argyle to his dying day. Nay, give me leave to remember you, that when that unfortunate Lord was in Cuſtody, and humbly requeſted but to ſpeak one word with the King before he was carried for Scotland, to be murder'd, you took upon you to reprove any that ſhould move the King, with this Jeer. That Argyle was one of the Godly Party, it was not for ſuch fellows to ſee the King: Or to that purpoſe; and the King your\nBrother was pleas'd to ſay, Let my Lord Argyle be content, he ſhall ſee the Maiden e're long, his own dearly beloved Invention. And nothing was a greater Argument for his Deſtruction than his Piety.\n               Sir, I can prove, that thoſe men who were concerned in Judging and Condemning your Father to death, tho' that was the Pretence or handle you took to have them cut off, yet the great reaſon why they were not ſpared was, that if they lived, and as long as they lived they would have been great Obſtacles in your way of debauching the People, and that was the reaſon of their being cut off; for old Courtney being at London, and admiring their demeanour and deportment in their Confinement, gave you an account of their Piety and Devotion. And ſo did old Hitchcock the Monk; but what Anſwer you made them was remarkable; your Brother and your ſelf would never have had them excepted, had you not been fully ſatisfied, that as long as they lived you could have no manner of proſpect of ſettling the Government, and advancing the Catholick Religion; both which have told me of their ſtedfaſtneſs and reſolution to the laſt degree, and could not forbear ſhedding of Tears when they diſcourſed that matter to me; and if you remember, it was the weaker part of thoſe men that had their Lives given them; not but that ſome of them were worthy perſons, but they had not arrived to thoſe Experiences of God and true Religion as the others had done, that laid down their Lives in that Cauſe. But the truth is, I never found many of them had ſo little Grace as to repent of what they had done.\nNay, your Rage did not ceaſe here; for you, by all the Wrong imaginable, pack'd a Parliament together of greenheaded young Gentlemen, the Sons of ſome Cavaliers, whoſe Parents ſuffer'd in the late War, and ſo were haters of Diſſenters, from whom an Act was obtained to empower Commiſſioners to diſplace all Officers that they ſhould judge not to be firm to the King's Intereſt and Proceedings: By this Knack you had all Juſtices of the Peace, and Corporation Magiſtrates, that had been forward in puniſhing Prophaneneſs and Ungodlineſs in their reſpective Places, and had been great Promoters of Religion and Holineſs of Life, turn'd out, and in their rooms were put all profane and ungodly Wretches, Swearers by, and Blaſphemers of the Name of Almighty God, theſe being Men for your Turn, that you might the more eaſily enſlave, and ſo pervert the People. And it was come to that paſs, that none could have any Employment unleſs he could ſwear and damn for the Church, tho' they never came within the inſide of one all their days. Of theſe, Sir, you made moſt excellent Papiſts in proceſs of time, or at leaſt Favourers of the Popiſh Party.\nYour Conſpirators had an Eye upon the City of London, and therefore, that none might ſtand in your way of debauching that City, all the ſober old Officers of the Army was not to come within 20 miles of it. This was done by the Advice of your old Friends the Prieſts, who viſited all your ſoured Cavaliers, and your Conſpiring Villains, and never left urging to them the danger the Government was in, till they were diſarm'd and baniſh'd London. 'Tis true, the great Argument was, the Safety of the Government; but the true one was, your making your progreſs in perverting the People to the Popiſh Religion; for all\nVirtue being diſcourag'd, both in Church and State, they had the fairer opportunity of proſelyting the prophaner part of Mankind to the Religion of the Church of Rome.\nI muſt confeſs, that ſome few that were ſober men had the fortune to be prefer'd both in Church and State; but what Joy you and your Conſpirators conceiv'd when they were remov'd either by Death or Age, is not forgotten. Thoſe Stateſmen that oppos'd Popery or Arbitrary Power were ſoon remov'd, and if they had the hap to dye in their Offices, they could do no more againſt Popery and Arbitrary Power than tell their Friends what Care you took to bring it in. But this I ſay, if any were but zealous, he was commonly laid aſide as uſeleſs and dangerous to the Government, for as long as they lived or continued in Power, you and your Party could not go on ſo ſmoothly in your Practices againſt our Religion, Laws and Liberties.\n2. It is well remember'd how your Conſpirators carried a Villanous Deſign of putting on Sham Plots upon Men, in order to take away their Lives and Eſtates, to the utter ruine of their Families and Poſterity for ever. Theſe were ſo many, that to enter into the Particulars of them would be enough to fill a Volume; but I will therefore reckon theſe that follow as the Chief of them.\n1. If you pleaſe, I pray you, Sir, to call to mind the riſing of the Fifth-Monarchy-men on the 6th of Jan. 1660/1. Who drew in thoſe men to that fooliſh and wicked Attempt but your old Acquaintance Dr. Goff, and Strange the Jeſuite, and Gray, and another Jeſuite that went by the name of St. George, and Aſhby, that was afterwards Rector at St. Omer's, who counterfeited themſelves Fifth Monarchy-men? For an Uncle of mine, one Mr. Thomas Buttivant, was engag'd with them, and had been in the Riſing, if the Three hundred Horſe had come they promiſed ſhould joyn Fifteen hundred Foot; and this Buttivant was to have been Commander in chief of the Horſe: He was ſo intimately acquainted with this Gray, that they called Brothers; this Gray I having ſeen ſo often with that Uncle of mine, that when I came to be acquainted with the Jeſuits, notwithſtanding it was ſo many years after, I found this Gray to be a Jeſuite, who had pretended to Fifth Monarchy Principles; and renewing my acquaintance with him, he told me, That he, and Strange, and others of the Society with this Goff, uſed to preach to them in Swan-Alley in Coleman-ſtreet, and at Mr. Buttivant's Houſe in Cobb's Yard in Petticoat-lane, and that they had drawn in ſeveral of thoſe poor Dogs, as they termed them, to be hang'd, but they themſelves were protected by you at St. James's, and in Whitehall; and 'tis true, that Gray had the Fifth-Monarchy Notions to a Hairs-breadth. In this Affair the Society were at ſome Hundreds of pounds charge, for they were liberal of their Mony, and poſſeſſed theſe poor Creatures of your Brother's and your being Papiſts, and that your deſign was to deſtroy the Intereſt of Chriſt in the three Nations, and to ſet up Popery and Slavery, and ſo drew them into that Folly of Riſing, and all with this intent, that they might obtain ſome ſevere Laws againſt the Proteſtant Diſſenters, in order to weaken the Proteſtant Intereſt within theſe three Nations, and boaſted very much of your being privy to the whole Deſign:\nAnd, by your Carriage in other Affairs, you will be by all ſober Proteſtants judged guilty of This.\nAgainſt ſuch ſtrange Practices the poor Diſſenters did at that time, in their Addreſſes and Declarations to the Government, poſitively, without any Equivocation or Mental Reſervation, declare and proteſt their abhorrence, and diſavowed all ſuch Principles as might tend to ſuch irregular and diſorderly Practiſes, as tending highly to the diſhonour of GOD and the Proteſtant Religion; yet you and your Jeſuites and Prieſts made great uſe of this, to beget a diſeſteem of them in the future Parliament.\n2. Another Conſpiracy was formed and contrived by you and your Banditti, againſt Proteſtants, and this was in November 1661. A doubty Knight of your Friendſhip forged ſeveral Letters from ſeveral Miniſters of the Goſpel about Worceſterſhire, and ſeveral other Counties; and in conjunction with this Villain ſeveral Jeſuites acted, amongſt whom was Father Fitz Patrick and Father Peter Talbot, afterwards the pretended Archbiſhop of Dublin, and old Courtney; all of theſe were employ'd by your ſelf, as I have ſeen in ſeveral Letters, wherein they complained of your delaying their being ſatisfied for that Service: But the Intrigue did not hold Water, tho' ſeveral honeſt men ſuffer'd Impriſonment for the ſame. But the Forgers and Framers of this Helliſh Conſpiracy in this pretended Plot had an aim at the rewarding Mr. Baxter for the great Service he did in your Brother's Reſtauration and yours.\n3. Another of the ſame nature was invented by your Conſpirators in Oxford, wherein the Names of ſeveral men of note and value, to the number of above a Hundred, whoſe Lives were deſign'd to have been made Sacrifices to Hell and Rome; but neither did that Cheat take any other effect than to continue the then Parliament exaſperated againſt poor Proteſtant Diſſenters, as men of reſtleſs Spirits, that were always diſturbing the Government. So that by theſe Artifices you did not only find a way to throw them out of their Livings, but endanger'd their Lives alſo.\n4. Your Prieſts and Jeſuites not making their Sham-Plots to hold upon the Diſſenters, your Conſpirators try what they could do with two Pillars of the Church of England, one Hill and Riggs, both highly carreſs'd by three ſpecial Guardians of the Church of England's Intereſt, that is, old Coſens, old Hinchman, and Sheldon, three of the Devil's Brokers. Theſe two Villains Hill and Riggs, both Parſons, they pretend to diſcover a Fanatick Plot, as they call'd it, againſt the King's, Yours, and old Monk's and Turncoat Brown's Lives, and this Plot was ſworn againſt ſeveral Honeſt Men, for which ſome loſt their Lives; the one got a preferment to a Living, and the other was preferred to eat Salt Beef and Pork and Peaſe at Sea, and ſometimes he acted as a Chaplain in a Ship, with great Promiſes of being preferred, but God cut him off, whilſt Hill ſlept in a Pocky Skin. Now, Sir, to lay open to you and the whole World the truth of this matter, I pray obſerve, that this Hill and this Riggs were in your Pay, to be Spies upon the Converſations of ſeveral Honeſt men, as Butler and Seely was afterwards in your Brothers for the ſame purpoſe; Riggs and Hill gets into the Company of ſeveral Diſſenters, and in their hearing did talk at a ſtrange rate\nagainſt the Government, and what a ſecret Cabal there was meeting in London for the change of the ſame; and how that the King your Brother and your ſelf were for introducing Popery and Slavery. But to prevent your Attempts of that ſort, the ſaid Riggs and Hill told them, That Arms and Ammunition were provided, and that a number of honeſt men were left to riſe, and defend the true Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the Kingdom; and that Deale Caſtle and Windſor Caſtle were to be ſurprized. This ſort of Talk they had with ſome few honeſt men, who in the Integrity of their Hearts confeſſed, that they heard Hill and Riggs talk at this rate. Nay, theſe Devils could not deny, but that they did uſe this ſort of talk, and intimated that they had a Licenſe ſo to do. Notwithſtanding theſe poor Creatures denied that ever they had any hand in any ſuch Conſpiracy, nor indeed was any thing proved, but what Hill and Riggs ſwore they had talk'd to them, yet they were condemn'd and baſely murder'd, and their Families ruin'd by your procurement, and Hill and Riggs eſcaped with Impunity, tho' not without Infamy. Your Jeſuites would have courted them both to the Church of Rome; but they appearing to be ſuch Rogues, they were afraid they would be a Diſgrace to them, who from their riſing up in the World had themſelves been a Scandal and Diſgrace to the Creation of God.\n               5. You having ſome Succeſs in this, your Conſpirators would not be idle, but drew in ſome warm Men into another Conſpiracy in the North. The then Sheriff of the County of York, and a great man whoſe Name I will omit, becauſe he did in part afterwards make England ſome amends for that piece of Villany, you know, at that time, to pleaſe the Court, he was reconciled to the Church of Rome, and no doubt, whilſt ſo, he was a fit Tool to carry on ſo wicked a Deſign, which was to diſcourſe of the Oppreſſion the Nation lay under thro' the Duties of Exciſe, &c. and the diſturbance that the Lawyers had made in the Kingdom; That your Brother and you were bringing in of Popery and Slavery, at which theſe poor Creatures were enflam'd; and being promis'd the ſupply of Mony, and by the High Sheriff the Aſſiſtance of Poſſe Comitatus, they were drawn in to engage: But alas, it was but a Trappan, they were taken and executed upon the Evidence of ſome of them that were engaged with them; but how you rewarded that Perſon of Quality afterwards it is well-enough known. This was another of your Projects, as the Perſon of Quality you employed hath told to ſeveral Friends with great Grief, ſome of whom are alive to this day.\nBut not to forget one paſſage, let me tell you, that you and your Conſpirators made at the Tryal of Mr. Alured two Witneſſes of one Man; firſt he appear'd in a ſtrange diſguiſe, with one Eye, and gave his Teſtimony under one Name, and then withdrew, and appear'd in his common Dreſs, and gave his teſtimony by his own Name, and ſo Alured was murder'd by the Conſpirators. This can be prov'd by good teſtimony.\n6. I will give you a ſhort Truth of the Fire of London, how that Eight Men were executed for having a deſign to fire the City of London on the third of September 1666. And great care was taken to lay it upon the Fifth-Monarchy-Men, and the old Officers of the Army that ſerved under the Parliament, but in truth it was contrived by your ſelf and your wicked Popiſh Party, and by you\nand them carried on to deſtroy that great Proteſtant City, that with more eaſe you and your Accomplices might introduce Popery and Slavery among us; for London was the Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion and Engliſh Liberties, and therefore ſhe muſt be made a Burnt-Offering to your ſelf and Helliſh Popiſh Crew.\n               7. Another Inſtance of your Conſpirators ſhamming their Plots upon poor innocent Proteſtants, and that is the Caſe of the Lord Claypool, and by this caſt an Odium upon the whole body of Proteſtant Diſſenters: For in the Month of Auguſt, juſt about the time that your Conſpirators were to execute their wicked Deſign to deſtroy the King, then you deal with Secretary Coventry, to clap up that poor innocent Gentleman, for deſigning to ſeize the King as he went to Newmarket; and you had two Witneſſes ready at hand to have ſworn that Deſign againſt him the ſaid Claypool, who was by the Secretary's Warrant arreſted for High Treaſon: But he the ſaid Claypool knowing nothing of the matter, demanded to know his Accuſers; that was (according to that Villain's uſual way) deny'd him, and he frown'd upon as if he had been the greateſt Knave in England next to Coventry himſelf. Claypool was as ſtout as that Knave of a Secretary was proud and inſolent; and as for Claypool, he would ſcarce anſwer any Queſtion, ſo away he was ſent to the Tower a cloſe Priſoner. This ſtartled every one except the Conſpirators and my ſelf, who was privy to the whole buſineſs, by the repeated Orders Coleman receiv'd from, Sir, your ſelf, for his Proſecution, that when the Blow was given upon the King, it might be charg'd upon the Fanaticks: And to that end Sing and Throgmorton, two virulent Papiſts, and Butler and Seely, two Popiſh Spies of your Brother's and yours, both pretended Fanaticks, the laſt, I think, is a Corniſh man, and was a Major in the late Protector's Army; ſo that you and all your Popiſh Conſpirators intended as one Man to revenge the Death of the King on the Diſſenting Party, concluding that the Vermin of the Church of England would ſtrike in with the Popiſh Party, ſince they hated a Diſſenter worſe than a Papiſt, tho' differing from them only in a few ſcoundrel Ceremonies not worthy to wipe a Porter's Tail withal: Therefore, as a Prologue to that curſed Deſign, you could not think of a man fitter than this Lord Claypool, he being Son-in-Law to that Lord Protector Cromwell; but you and your Villains were diſappointed for a time from deſtroying the King, for when the true Plot was diſcover'd, your deviliſh Witneſſes againſt the Proteſtant Party diſappear'd. And ſo much for Claypool.\n\n8. Another Inſtance of your implacable Hatred to the Proteſtants, and of your deſigning to ſham a Plot upon them, was your old and very good Friend Mr. Thomas Blood, whom you and your Brother ſet upon my ſelf, to bring me into a Conſpiracy with Richard late Lord Protector, and him the ſaid Blood, to dethrone your Brother and your ſelf; which, Sir, was a great miſtake, for your Crimes were ſo plain and notorious, that an honeſt man would have thought the Laws of the Land and publick Juſtice would have reach'd you both without ſuch irregular Methods as theſe were; but I diſcover'd the Letter, and the Trappan eſcap'd for a while, and then God cut him off with Infamy and Diſgrace.\n\n9. I muſt entreat your patience to remember another Inſtance, and that is the particular Caſe of Mr. Thomas Dangerfield, who was maintained by you and your Conſpirators with Twelve pounds per week, to invent a Plot againſt the Proteſtants, the better to colour or hide your own. What Papers you and the reſt of your Conſpirators contrived to be put upon the Duke of Buckingham! The Gentleman of his Horſe was Mansfield, and he was prepared to be a ſecond Witneſs againſt the ſaid Duke, as Dangerfield was ſuborned to be the firſt, ſo that you might have the Blood of that great man, as being one in a Conſpiracy to deſtroy the King your Brother. But Dangerfield had not been ſo mindful of his Leſſon as he ought, and fixeth himſelf upon one Manſel, who had been a Retainer to the Earl of Eſſex, who at that time was carried away with the diſſimulation of the Popiſhly-affected Party, but inſtead of leaving them in Mansfield's Chamber, left them in Manſel's Chamber. In theſe Papers there was a Liſt of Noblemen and Gentlemen that were to be ſworn againſt, as being in a Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the King your Brother, and your ſelf, and Church of England: And, to make the World believe that theſe Papers were not forged, this Dangerfield repairs to Secretary Coventry, your old League-breaker, and informs the Secretary (who was privy to the whole Concern) of a dangerous Plot againſt the Government, and that there were dangerous Papers in the Chamber of Coll. Manſel, that would make the ſame out: but the fellow, tho' he had been a Rogue all his days, as God would have it, ſcrupl'd the Oath; tho' if he had ſaid in Mansfield's Chamber, he ſhould have had a Warrant without an Oath; but mentioning the Name of Manſel, the Secretary was ſtartled, becauſe that Manſel was a Favourite of the Earl of Eſſex, againſt whom this Conſpiracy was not at firſt to appear, therefore Coventry would do nothing without an Oath in relation to Manſel, becauſe of the Earl of Eſſex, who was then actually a Privy Councillor; therefore Dangerfield was reſolv'd to have the papers brought to light, and therefore gets an Officer or Officers of the Cuſtomhouſe, to ſearch Manſel's Chamber for prohibited Goods, and then theſe papers were ſeiz'd: And Manſel hearing of what was done when he came to his Lodging, and that papers of dangerous conſequence was found in his Chamber, behind his Beds-head, where he had never laid any, he immediately repairs to the Council, and complains of his uſage before Dangerfield had told his Story.\n               Well then, what becomes of this Affair, ſo fooliſhly miſcarrying in its firſt birth? I muſt obſerve to you, that Dangerfield is called in queſtion; and tho' he had many Friends in the Council, and many that knew the Deſign well enough, yet the Blunder that Dangerfield made was ſo great, and his Story hung ſo ill together, that the Conſpirators that were at the Board began to be confounded, and were much dejected that their Tool had ſucceeded no better; for, beſides all his ſelf-contradictions, ſhrewd proofs were brought againſt him: Yet notwithſtanding the aforeſaid blunder, and his being ſo confronted with Major Richardſon and others, Dangerfield was as bold as his Folly was great, and ſtood in it, that the Papers taken in Manſel's Lodgings were not put there by him, till at laſt the proof of the Cuſtomhouſe Officer that ſearched, and\nDangerfield's own words, the Cheat and the Roguery was moſt manifeſt; ſo that the Council, tho' many of them your Conſpirators and his intimate Friends, were of neceſſity obliged to commit him to Newgate, who being there, was ſtill upheld by that Whore Cellier, and the reſt of your Conſpirators, who had redeem'd him out of Newgate for this very end and purpoſe, and had forbad him to diſcover; but ſome Letters being diſcover'd, and he being out of all hopes, made his application to the then Lord Mayor to take his diſcovery; which was done, and upon that Diſcovery it plainly appear'd who ſet him on work to frame ſuch a piece of Villany. You were ſo nettl'd at the Diſcovery, that inſtead of the Lord Mayor's having Thanks return'd him for his Service to the King and the Nation, that he met with a Check at Court for meddling in that which concerned him not. But by this Trick the Earl of Eſſex's Eyes were open'd, and he fairly left you and the Council, abhorring ſuch Villanies as never was to be parallel'd in future, nor heard of in paſt Ages.\n               Your Sham-Plot thus miſcarrying, and the Book found in the Meal-Tub, ſhewing who they were that was to be ſworn out of their Lives falſly, appearing, you know, Sir, that you were, with your Accomplices, at a ſtand; for, Sir, you know that this Villany, if it had been placed with Mansfield, the Duke of Buckingham's Servant, who was to have been a ſecond Witneſs with Dangerfield, and both theſe to have been corroborated by Blood, Butler, and Seely, you would have cut off, by a Form of Juſtice, all ſuch perſons as had ſtood in oppoſition to your wicked Deſigns and Practices; ſo that a new Parliament ſhould have been open'd with the noiſe of a Presbyterian Plot, therefore you know the Parliament was prorogued for a longer time, and your ſelf forced to part with a ſmall Spell to get this thing done, and the French King preſſed for a bigger Seame, which was happily prevented by the Duke of Buckingham.\n\n10. I muſt beg your Pardon if I put you in mind of another piece of Roguery your reſtleſs Conſpirators undertook; For a new Parliament being to meet at Oxford, in the year 1680/1, they were reſolved to welcom that Parliament with a Proteſtant Plot in good earneſt, to the end with more eaſe you might bring your curſed Deſigns to paſs. In order to this, it was agreed by your Crew, that Papers containing Treaſonable Matters ſhould be got to be written, and lodg'd in the Houſes of private men, and ſhuffled into Gentlemen's Pockets at Oxford, and before the meeting of the Parliament they ſhould be ſeiz'd with ſuch Papers about them; and one Fitz-Harris, who was to be their Tool, was well acquainted with one Everard, that was a Villain much of the ſaid Fitz-Harris's ſtature or ſtandard; for it was a hard matter to know which was the greateſt of the two. This Everard had been countenanc'd by the Earl of Shaftsbury, and therefore the ſaid Everard was judg'd the moſt fit to joyn with him in the Roguery: And Everard had agreed with this Fitz-Harris to be ſeized with theſe Papers about him, when they had diſperſed as many of them as would do the buſineſs; but thoſe that employ'd theſe Raſcals in this affair were ſuch, that it would \n•\nill\nan Engliſhman with Confuſion to name them. Fitz-Harris had his Inſtructions from your Brother and Portſmouth, and when Acceſs could not be had to them, then they received them from Nell Wall, a notorious Whore, that from a poor Wench that waſhed down the Stairs, was made her Miſtreſſes Woman, and privy to the whole Intrigue.\n               The Writing was drawn up, and much approved by the King your Brother and the Dutcheſs, and their Approbation ſignified to this Fitz-Harris by this Whore Nell Wall, and the ſame told to this Everard by Fitz-Harris; but no Mony conſiderable appearing, unleſs it were one Thirty pound, Everard diſcovers this Intrigue to one Smith, commonly call'd Narrative Smith, and Sir William Waller. They are planted in a ſecret Room, where they might not only hear, but ſee the Tranſactions between Everard and this Fitz-Harris; ſo that Fitz-Harris was apprehended and committed upon Everard's Teſtimony, and Try'd and Condemn'd upon the Teſtmony of Smith, and Waller, and Everard, and fairly Hang'd, that he might not tell Tales. So Shaftsbury and ſeveral others eſcaped that one time from being made a Sacrifice to your Will and Pleaſure. The Story, Sir, is too long to be fully repeated, but when any of your Curſed Crew ſhall Anſwer this, I ſhall tell the whole Story at length; but this ſhall ſuffice for this Particular.\n11. Be pleas'd to remember how many Iriſh men were ſuborned to ſwear againſt the Life of the ſaid Earl of Shaftsbury, and how diligent your Conſpirators were to ſuborn others that were of the ſame ſtamp for Roguery and Villany; but God, by the Induſtry and Care of his Friends, deliver'd him; and what theſe Villains ſwore againſt him was ſo inconſiſtent with either the Principles or declared Judgment of that Noble Lord, and the Particulars of their Teſtimony ſo contradictory one to the other, that the Grand Jury would not return a billa ver a upon the Teſtimony of theſe Rogues, tho' the Court uſed all the indirect methods with that Jury to have the Bill found.\n12. Sir, I muſt deal plainly with you and your Tribe, that my Heart is ready to bleed when I muſt name to you the Murther of the Earl of Eſſex, whoſe Throat you procured to be cut that very Morning, that a Way might be made for the Horrible Murther of the Lord Ruſſel, who was by your means baſely murder'd by a Form of Law; and the great Collonel Sidney, what Juries of Common Rogues and Villains were pack'd upon them by the contrivance of murdering Rich and North, your two pretended Sheriffs of London and Middleſex, Fellows that valued not the Blood of a Proteſtant, but rejoyced that they had made you and your Conſpirators drunk with their Blood!\nI muſt not forget poor Stephen Colledge, who was baſely murder'd at Oxford by a Sett of wicked Judges, and a Pack'd Jury, at Oxford, whoſe Blood cries to Heaven for Vengeance againſt you and your Cut-throat Party.\n\nWe have a Cloud of Inſtances againſt you and your Party of your ſuborning Witneſſes againſt Mr. Colt, Mr. Arnold, Sir Samuel Barnadiſton, Mr. Covet, Mr. Culliford, Mr. Braddon, Mr. Johnſon, Sir Thomas Pilkington, and Mr. Hampden, my ſelf and others; what a long and tedious Impriſonment we all ſuffer'd through the Teſtimony of your ſuborned and perjur'd Witneſſes. But this may ſuffice for this ſecond Particular, how you and your Conſpirators, from the very time of your being reſtor'd to your Native Country, which was in the year 1660, to the year 1685, that you took the Crown.\n               III. A third Project that you and your Popiſh Crew had on foot was, to ruine our Trade. It was not enough that you fired our Cities, and abuſed the Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Religion, by the many Murders that were by you and your Party committed, by the help of your Mercenary Judges and Hackney Jury-men, but you alſo labour'd heartily to diſturb the Trade of the Nation, that you might with more eaſe enſlave it, and bring in Popery upon us. I will but give you only one or two Inſtances; Many might be given, to your Shame, and the Shame of your Party, if there was any ſuch thing remaining with you.\n1. The firſt Inſtance I ſhall give you is the countenancing the French King to take ſo many of our Merchants Ships by his Pyrates and Rovers in our Seas; and ſeveral Letters were written by your Secretary Mr. Coleman, to Sir Ellys Leyton, wherein ſeveral Merchantmen, whoſe Owners and Merchants had been obnoxious to you or your Party, by oppoſing Popery and Slavery; he was by your eſpecial Order to ſee their Ships and Goods condemned, to the utter undoing of ſeveral Families. And your Servant Coleman, when any thing of a Tradeſman was mentioned, he uſed to ſay, Damn them, they are a ſort of Fanaticks that have no Kindneſs for my Maſter, or our Religion, and it will be never well till we make them poor, then they will be brought to obey. Nay, Sir, this was your Language too, or elſe you would never have been ſo much of the Opinion of the French King, your moſt Chriſtian Brother.\n2. A ſecond Inſtance is taken from the Letters that were written to the Rector of St. Omers, Richard Aſhby, from Thomas White and John Keines, and others of the Society in London, in which Letters from them and others were encloſed Letters to Thomas Stapletoa, then Procurator at Bruxels, to perſwade the Father Confeſſor of Duke de Villa Hermoſa, then Governor of the Spaniſh Netherlands, to inform him the ſaid Duke, That the King your Brother did not intend to aſſiſt the King of Spain, but would ſtand a looker on till he was ruin'd by the French King. Which Letter being not ſealed, I ſaw it; and that in caſe the Father Confeſſor to the ſaid Governor ſhould not be ready to comply with the ſaid Stapleton, that Meſſengers ſhould be forthwith ſent to Father Swiman at Madrid, to inform the King of Spain of the ſaid Concern, and to make the ſame relation of the buſineſs to the Popiſh Archbiſhop of Tuam, of the Kingdom of Ireland, who was then at the Court at Madrid, that he the ſaid Swiman and the ſaid Titular Archbiſhop, might jointly give\nan account of the Motion made or to be made to the ſaid Father Confeſſor of Duke de Villa Hermoſa, and alſo to adviſe the Spaniſh King to ſeize the Eſtates of the Engliſh Merchants in their ſeveral Factories in his Dominions, for that they had endeavour'd to tranſport their Eſtates, and did tranſport them to England, and all, or moſt part, in the Coin of Spain, to the great Prejudice of the Kingdom of Spain. And for the confirmation thereof, they procur'd Letters from one Fonſeca, ſometimes an Agent in London, to atteſt the ſame, this Fonſeca willingly complying with your Conſpirators, and ſent his Letter to St. Omer's, that the Fathers there might give their Approbation to the ſaid Letter, in order to be ſent to the Court of Spain; which Letter was long and large, Atteſtations therein made againſt the Merchants of the ſeveral Factories concerning the Matter of Fact before mentioned, and other Letters were diſpatch'd to Daniel Armſtrong at Valladolyd, and John Croſs then at Madrid, in which they were order'd to confirm this Atteſtation made or to be made by the Fathers in England, and of the Engliſh Seminary at St. Omer's, and of the ſaid Stapleton, together with that of the ſaid Fonſeca, the abovenamed Spaniſh Agent, who then lived at Bruges in Flanders. Therefore,\n               1. In this Villanous Contrivance to diſturb the Nation in the Spaniſh Trade, your Servant Coleman was very active in your Name, and on your behalf, and engaged that your Letter to Villa Hermoſa ſhould be procured.\n2. It is well known that your Brother and your ſelf were ſo engag'd with the French King that it was all one to you what became of the King of Spain's Concerns in Flanders; but you were both grieved to ſee the Engliſh Nation enrich'd with the Trade it had with Spain; for, during the time of the Riches and Plenty of England, it would be very difficult for you and your Conſpirators to bring in Popery and Slavery upon us.\n3. What Agents you make uſe of to carry on this Wicked Deſign to ruine Trade! Even Fonſeca, that hated the Engliſh Nation, and much envied her Greatneſs, and that ſhe might be in a condition to be brought under the French Yoke, you tamper with him, that tho' a Spaniard by Nation, yet he was wholly in the French Intereſt.\n3. A third Inſtance that I ſhall remember you of, by which you intended to ruine our Trade, and that was in the adulterating, debaſing and clipping the Coin of this Kingdom. It may be ſaid by you and your Partiſans, That it is very hard you ſhould be charged with this vile Act; but, Sir, it can be prov'd, that the Merchants, Goldſmiths, Brokers, Bankers, and the other Traders that the Jeſuites dealt with, all was by your Advice and Direction, and that your Servant Coleman had in your Name promiſed them the management of the Mint: So that your Conſpirators were to be the Judges of good and bad Mony, and were to manage the ſame to the beſt\nadvantage for your Cauſe, and ſeveral Materials for Coining was provided by Smith your Agent, and lodged at Mr. Longhorn's Chambers in the Temple. And this, Sir, I muſt obſerve to you for publick Good, that there hath been few or none that ever hath been executed but hath been of your Religion or Intereſt. That our Mony hath been abuſed is notorious. And all this you did in order to impoveriſh the Kingdom, and deſtroy its Trade.\n               4. A fourth Inſtance of you and your Traytors to diſturb the Trade of the Kingdom, was the Fire of London. I have treated of that already. As it was the Habitation for ſeveral Thouſands of good Proteſtants, that ſtood in oppoſition to Popery and Slavery; and as by the deſtroying this City you endeavoured to weaken the Proteſtant Intereſt, ſo now give me leave to tell you, it was with this deſign, to ruine the Trade of the Nation; for you know, that London was the Metropolis and Fountain of Trade, and when ſhe was deſtroy'd you could not but conclude, that the Trade muſt be diſturbed (with which the other parts of the Kingdom were made happy) through the great devaſtation that the Fire, that was carried on by your Wicked Inſtruments, had made.\nIV. A fourth Project that you had to accompliſh your Wicked Deſigns, was the Attempt of maintaining of a ſtanding Army, contrary to the Laws and Liberties of England in the times of Peace, and labour'd that point much with the King your Brother, to lay down the legal Force of this Kingdom (viz. the Militia) as uſeleſs to the Government; and therefore you and your Party advis'd him to lay them down, and to have Forces in every County under Pay, and they were to be your Conſervators of the Peace. And, Sir, had the Revenue of the Crown been able to have born the Charge, you your ſelf projected a ſtanding Army, to keep the People in due Obedience. Now, what that due Obedience was, I ſhall not need to explain to you, for it was a ſtanding Army alamode de France; nay, they were to have the Power of the Civil Watch in the Night, which you ſaid would excuſe many ancient uſeleſs Men from that Service. And for the accompliſhment of your wicked Enterprize, you advis'd, that the greater part of the Army ſhould conſiſt of French and Iriſh, and that the Officers of this Army ſhould conſiſt of as many Roman Catholicks as could well be gotten to ſerve in that Army, and you had ſeveral of that ſort of Cattel that you kept in half-pay, in readineſs whenever your Brother ſhould have agreed to your Advice. It was not for want of Good will, but for want of Mony, that your Deſign did not then take.\n5. A fifth Project that you had on foot to enſlave the Nation, and that was, the adviſing and contriving with your damnable Conſpirators the ſeizure of the Charters, Franchiſes, and Liberties of the Cities, Towns, and ancient Corporations of the Kingdom. It was, Sir, your ſelf and your Conſpirators that invaded the Privileges, and ſeized on the Charters of moſt of the Towns that had a Right to be repreſented by their Burgeſſes in Parliament, and by over awing ſome of them, you procur'd Surrenders of them to be made\nto the King your Brother, by which the Magiſtrates deliver'd up all their Rights and Privileges, to be diſpos'd of at his pleaſure, and the pleaſure of your ſelf and Conſpirators. Upon this you procur'd new Magiſtrates to be placed in thoſe Places as would carry on your wicked deſigns and purpoſes of advancing Popery and Slavery.\n               6. It was your Advice, together with your Conſpirators, that put the late King your Brother to turn out of the Commiſſion of the Peace and the Lieutenancy of the Counties, all ſuch who had been zealous for the defence of the Proteſtant Religion and Liberty, and had appear'd vigorouſly againſt Popery and Arbitrary Power, as perſons diſaffected to the Government both in Church and State, and repreſented them as Fanaticks, and Favourers of ſuch; by which means you got in Men of Villanous Morals, and ſuch heartily joyned in with your Conſpirators, to ruine the Proteſtant Intereſt, and to overthrow the Laws and Liberties of England. This was done in the year 1679.\n7. Notwithſtanding ſome of your Conſpirators repreſented you as a perſon whoſe Judgment was for Liberty of Conſcience, yet becauſe the Proteſtant Diſſenters appear'd earneſtly in the aſſerting the Laws and Liberties of England, and gave Countenance to the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot to, King Charles your Brother, who was in it in every part and particular thereof, excepting that of his own Murther; you and your Conſpirators ſtirred up that King to raiſe a terrible Perſecution againſt thoſe men, by which means you were the ruine of ſome Thouſands of Families, who by the ſeverity of the ſaid Perſecution were reduced almoſt to Beggery, or to live upon the Charity of Friends. Some were forced to fly the Nation, and yet were more loyal under their Preſſures and Provocations than your Cut-throat Papiſts were under their then Careſſes and Favours received from your Brother and your ſelf. Nay, a reverend Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt, who had been very inſtrumental in your Reſtauration, yea, and ventur'd his Life for your Brother's Reſtauration, in the year 1650, you ſuffer'd to periſh in Newgate, as a Reward for ſo great a piece of Service to your Brother and your ſelf and Family; and for no other reaſon, but becauſe he could not comply with ſome Raſcally Ceremonies that our Eccleſiaſtical Vermin had borrow'd from the Church of Rome, to Adorn our Proteſtant Worſhip, and becauſe he would not take the Oxford Oath, lay'd upon the Nation to enſlave it.\n8. Another Project you had for the ruining the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Intereſt of England, was the Advancing of Men that were Enemies to the Proteſtant Intereſt into the greateſt Places of Truſt. As, What a Sett of Villains had you made Judges of the Land, by which means you brought all the Matters of Civil Juſtice into great Uncertainties, by reaſon of the Tenour of their Commiſſions, and the Ignorance of the Rogues you employ'd! Therefore how miſerable was the Nation, who were obliged to Anſwer to ſuch Judges that were forced to comply in all things\nwith the Directions that were given by you and your Wicked Cut-throats, or elſe to be turned out at yours and their Pleaſure?\n               If we look further, you had, in your Brother's time, the diſpoſing of all Military Employments; And how you did ſhew your Hatred to the Proteſtant Religion and the Engliſh Intereſt! You did in his time raiſe a great many Perſons to the greateſt Military Truſts both by Sea and Land, Strangers as well as Natives; ſo that by theſe meaſures your Conſpirators became Maſters of the Affairs of the Government of the Nation, and of the courſe of Juſtice; and you had all the Church Vermin engag'd with you to ſubject the whole Kingdom to a deſpotick Arbitrary power; and all theſe joyn'd together to execute your wicked Deſigns, to enſlave and debauch the People of the Land.\n9. To compleat the Work, that nothing might ſtand in your way of Eſtabliſhing your Popiſh Religion, you murder'd your Brother, who was uncertain in his Engagements in the Conſpiracy; for, when he found it was not ſafe for him to appear in promoting Popery, he ſoon left you. Or if a Sum of Money could be gotten from a Parliament, he commonly bleſs'd the Nation with a Proclamation or two againſt Popiſh Prieſts, Jeſuites, and Popiſh Recuſants, or paſs a Bill or ſo to the prejudice of the Popiſh Party; as he did in 1673, when the Teſt-Bill paſſed; as alſo another in 1678. This obliged you and your Conſpirators to haſten his deſtruction, which you had long contrived. You found a fit Tool, and as fit a Doſe to do the Work; in it you had your deſired Ends, and ſo you mounted the Throne. Which brings me to the Second Point, What you did in order to the Ruine of the Proteſtant Religion and the Government after your acceſſion to the Crown.\n\nII. Your Tyranny was very cruel, but ſhort, yet full of ſtrange and ſurpriſing Circumſtances: It was highly aſtoniſhing to ſee a Popiſh Prince aſcending the Throne, to rule a Proteſtant Nation, and defend a Proteſtant Church; but, Sir, you had no ſuch Deſigns in your Head, for you ſhew'd what you would do with our Laws, when you could engage your Conſpirators to diſpenſe with part of the Oaths that you ſhould have taken. It is manifeſt and notorious, that when you were upon the coming to the Crown you was receiv'd by all the People of England, Scotland, and Ireland as King, without the leaſt oppoſition, for our Eccleſiaſtical Vermin had made your way clear by their Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance, and the Divine Right of Succeſſion, and the poſſibility of preſerving the Glory and Grandeur of their Church of England by a Popiſh Prince, and that there was more danger from Fanaticks than from Papiſts, and ſuch-like ſcoundrel Notions.\nYou cannot but remember, that King Charles your Brother, having received the deadly Doſe your Conſpirators had prepar'd for him, on February the 6th, 1684/5, he went to his Place; that very day, Sir, you were proclaim'd\nKing, to the ſorrow of all that wiſh'd well to England, and its Religion, Liberties and Laws: you then appear'd at the Council-Table as King, and by all your Conſpirators you was owned and ſaluted as ſuch, to whom you were pleas'd to make a ſort of a Speech, in which you were pleas'd to declare your ſelf to this effect.\n               THat Since it hath pleaſed Almighty God to place you in that ſtation, and that you were now to ſucceed ſo Good and Gracious a King, as well as ſo Kind a Brother, you thought it fit to declare, That you would follow his Example, and more eſpecially in that of his great Clemency and Tenderneſs to all his People: That you had been reported to have been a man for Arbitrary Power, tho' that had not been the only Story that had been made of you: That you would make it your Endeavour to preſerve Government both in Church and State, as it was by Law eſtabliſh'd: That you knew the Principles of the Church of England were for Monarchy, and that the Members of it had ſhewn themſelves good and loyal Subjects, and therefore you would take care to defend and ſupport it: That you knew the Laws of England were ſufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as you could wiſh; and therefore, as you would never depart from the Juſt Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown, ſo you would never invade any Man's Property: And that you had ventur'd your Life very often in the defence of the Nation: And that you would go as far as any Man in preſerving it in all its Juſt Rights and Liberties.\n\nThis, Sir, is the ſum and ſubſtance of what you were pleas'd to ſay at the Council board; and one would have ſworn that you would have taken up the Trade of being Speech wright-general to the whole Band of your Conſpirators. I am confident your old Friends the Jeſuites, that had been hang'd but a little before, could not have outdone you, though it had been to have ſaved their Lives. Well, it was a Speech, and how true you were to this Speech you ſhall judge, and your Conſpirators too, if you will but conſider.\n1. You ſaid, You would not invade any man's Right and Property, and that you would preſerve the Nation in its Juſt Rights and Liberties. And ſo you did, for you, the next day after your acceſſion to the Crown, publiſh'd a Proclamation for the continuing the payment of the Cuſtom and Exciſe, which were expir'd by the death of the King your Brother for ſeveral weeks after. Did not this ſhew you to be a man for Arbitrary Power, to invade the Properties of a great part of the Subjects of England by your Proclamation; what Value you had for the Rights of the Nation, for whom you had ventur'd\nyour Life in a Coiled Cable; and what Regard you had to its Laws, that at your firſt ſtep in your pretended Government you bring in a Proclamation equivalent to thoſe Laws that expir'd as aforeſaid, by which the Exciſe and Cuſtoms in the time of the Reign of your kind and loving Brother had been ſetled and paid.\n               2. You ſaid, That you would follow the Example of your Brother, in his Clemency and Tenderneſs to the People of England. What your Brother's Clemency and Tenderneſs to the people of England was, I am yet to learn. What was his Clemency to his old Cavaliers, that had ſerv'd both his Father and him in the Wars, to the ruine of themſelves and Families, ſpending their Subſtance in both their Services, and not ſo much as looked upon when you were reſtor'd? After that Sir John Webſter, a Merchant, had lent him 150000 l. Sterling, did not he, after much Importunity, reward the ſaid Sir John with the refuſal of a Land-waiter's Place, and graciouſly ſuffer'd the poor man to ſtarve, as a Reward of his Loyalty? Was not his Clemency ſuch, that within the compaſs of a very few years all his whole Intereſt was melted down into a ſmall Regiment of Pimps, Whores, and Bawds, on whom he laviſhly confer'd great Honours, and on them he profuſely ſpent the Treaſure of the Nation.\nRemember, Sir, how his Clemency was extended to thoſe Miniſters that brought him home, and to that Party of Men that reſtor'd him to his Crown and Dignity. Mr. Jenkins is a notable Inſtance of his Clemency, who ventur'd his Life for his Reſtoration, in that Cauſe that Mr. Love loſt his. What a Tenderneſs he had for Mr. Jenkins▪\n was ſeen in his murdering him in Priſon, notwithſtanding all the humble application made to your tender Brother, for his releaſe, in order to preſerve his Life.\nHis Clemency to Sir Henry Vane was admirable, for rather than Vane ſhould not be ſent to Heaven, he broke through an Act of Parliament, leſt the Martyr ſhould find delay in his paſſage thither. What can you ſay of his Clemency to Great Eſſex, and Noble Ruſſel, whom he baſely and barbarouſly murder'd? I think that Sir Thomas Armſtrong is another Inſtance of his Clemency. And ſo you were as good as your word, in following the Example of his Clemency and Tenderneſs to the People of England.\n\nFor upon your entering into the Regal State, you let England have a taſte of your Clemency. I muſt begin with my own Caſe; I ſufficiently taſted of your Grace and Favour after that with the hazard of my Life; I had diſcover'd a Damnable Conſpiracy, carried on by the Popiſh Party, for the deſtruction of the King your Brother and the Proteſtant Religion, and the Government of the Nation; how you uſed me let all the World judge, notwithſtanding the Credit the Parliament had given me; as you may rememember in the Vote of March 15. 1679.\n\nReſolved, Nemine Contradicente, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament aſſembled, That they do declare that they are fully ſatisfied,\nby the Proofs they have heard, that there now is, and for divers years laſt paſt hath been, an Horrid and Treaſonable Plot and Conſpiracy, continued and carried on by thoſe of the Popiſh Religion, for the murdering of His Majeſty's Sacred Perſon, and for ſubverting the Proteſtant Religion, and the Ancient Eſtabliſh'd Government of this Kingdom.\nNotwithſtanding all your Clemency and Tenderneſs to the Engliſh Nation, produce ſuch a Vote for the Juſtifying your Reputation in the Nation, and for ought I know, you may perſwade your ſelf that the Nation may be enclin'd to receive you into favour again, and admit your tender Government of them once more.\nBut to return to the Point. Notwithſtanding the Power of Truth and the Credit of this Vote, with what implacable Malice did you and your Banditti purſue me? How often did you attempt to take away my Life by the Teſtimony of Falſe Witneſſes? With what Importunity did you prevail upon the King your Brother to withdraw that Protection and Subſiſtance that the ſaid King allow'd me at the requeſt of ſeveral Parliaments, ſo that I might ſtarve for want of Bread? Nay, to expreſs your Clemency and Tenderneſs, how warmly did you proſecute me in an Action of Scandalum Magnatum, for ſpeaking this Notorious Truth of you, That you were reconciled to the Church of Rome, and that it was High Treaſon to be ſo reconcil'd? And what a noble Verdict a pack'd Jury of your Conſpirators, upon the proſecution, brought in againſt me, of One hundred thouſand Pound Damages? And thereupon you generouſly Charged me in Execution in the Kings-Bench Priſon.\nAnd was you afraid that I was Able to have paid the Debt and Charges, and as Willing as Able? Well, to prevent it, you reſolv'd that I ſhould not want your Clemency and Tenderneſs; you therefore, to juſtifie thoſe Vertues to be inherent in you, you prevail'd with King Charles the Second to give you and your Conſpirators Leave to prefer two ſeveral Indictments of two pretended Perjuries in my Evidence concerning the Popiſh Plot, but your Villains would not let the King your Brother live to ſee thoſe Indictments try'd, therefore they were brought to tryal in your tender Reign. What ſort of Witneſſes did you produce againſt me, but thoſe very men that had been in no leſs than three Tryals prov'd and judg'd to be Falſe Witneſſes, the Religion they profeſſed no ways admitting them to be Credible; and therefore, as they were not believ'd when they gave their Teſtimony without an Oath, ſo they were not to be believ'd when they were upon their Oaths; for you know, tender Sir, they were of a Religion that could diſpenſe with Oaths, tho' falſe, for the ſake of your Catholick Cauſe.\nTheſe, Sir, were your Witneſſes; and you had two Juries of Men that had as large a Faith to believe as the Rogues had Conſciences to ſwear, and ſo I muſt averr Juries and Witneſſes to be alike, for he is as criminal, and is as much damn'd, that believes a Lye, as he is that makes one and ſwears it too; for the Rogues your mercenary wicked Judges, and the Villains that were Witneſſes, and your pack'd Hell-born Jury-men, were all in (as it were) a Confederacy, to be reveng'd on me for the diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and to caſt a\nReproach upon the Wiſdom and Honour of four ſucceſſive Parliaments, and upon the publick Juſtice of the Nation.\n               Well, Sir, I was convicted, notwithſtanding the Witneſſes I brought in, who were brow-beaten, abuſed by that Villain Jefferies, who had neither Law nor Sence, nor Manners, but had the Impudence of Ten Carted Whores; therefore nothing now remained for me but Judgment, which was your own appointing, with the Advice of your twelve Villains that were of the Lambskin Order, and others of your Conſpirators, as a Mark of your Clemency and Tenderneſs towards me. The Sentence was as barbarous and inhuman as it was unjuſt; for I was to pay to you Two thouſand Marks, to be diveſted of my Canonical Habit, and brought into Weſtminſter-Hall with a Paper upon my Head with this Inſcription; Titus Dates, convicted upon full Evidence of two Horrid Perjuries; to ſtand in and upon the Pillory for two ſeveral days; on Wedneſday to be Whip'd from Aldgate to Newgate, and on the Friday following from Newgate to Tyburn; and to ſtand in and upon the Pillory five times every year of my Life, and to remain a Priſoner during Life.\n\nThis Sentence ſounded ill in the Ears of moſt Men, and filled many with Horror and Amazement, when they conſider'd the great Clemency and Tenderneſs that you did in your Speech but a little before mention to the Council, and therefore ſome perſons of known worth and quality made application to you to mitigate the Sentence, but were refus'd with the gracious Saying, That I ſhould go through it if I had breath in my body. And then, judging that your Italian Comrade might have this Clemency and Tenderneſs of yours under her Lock and Key, application was made to her Ladiſhip, but they found that ſhe was reſolv'd upon my Deſtruction; they return'd home, holding up their Eyes and Hands to Heaven with a Lord have Mercy upon us. Truly, Sir, it was their Good-will to me, but it was their Inadvertency to make any Application to you or your Italian Pugg; for it was the Example of your Brother's Clemency and Tenderneſs that you were reſolv'd to follow.\nSince it was ſo, not only I, but all thinking men, did then judge that your unparallel'd Sentence thus pronounc'd was to murder me; and therefore to juſtifie the inherent Clemency and Tenderneſs that you had for a poor Engliſh Proteſtant, the ſaid Sentence was executed with all the Circumſtances of Barbarity, for I ſuffer'd ſome thouſands of Stripes, by which I was put to unſpeakable Tortures, and lay ten weeks under the Chyrurgeons hands. But, Sir, your Malice and Malicious Clemency and Barbarous Tenderneſs did not ceaſe here; but becauſe I, thro' the great Mercy of Almighty God ſupporting me, and the extraordinary Care and Skill of a Judicious Chyrurgeon, outliv'd your Cruelty; for ſuch were your tender Mercies to me, you ſent ſome of your Cut-throat Crew, whilſt I was weak in my Bed, to pull off thoſe Plaiſters applied to cure my Back, and in your moſt gracious Name they threatned me with all Courteſie and Humanity to deſtroy me.\nSurely, Sir, a Man would have thought that by this time you had given Teſtimony enough of your Tenderneſs and Clemency, but I found to my Coſt that I was to taſte a little more of your Grace and Mercy; for by your own Command I was loaded with Irons of exceſſive weight, for the ſpace of one whole year without any intermiſſion, and of your Princely Compaſſion they\nwere not ſuffer'd to be taken off even when my Legs were ſwoln with the Gout. Nay, that I might appear to partake of the utmoſt of your Mercy, I was by your order ſhut up in the Hole or Dungeon of the Priſon, whereby I became impair'd of my Limbs, and contracted Convulſion Fits, to the hazard of my Life. But when you had fill'd up the meaſure of your Sins, and the Nation came to its ſelf, you were by the juſt Judgment of God driven out of the Kingdom, and a Parliament freely choſen did ſit, obſerve the Judgment they made of your Grace and Clemency and Tenderneſs; in order to which read the Vote of the Houſe of Commons June 11. 1689. which was this; Reſolved, That the Proſecution of Titus Oates, upon two Indictments of Perjury, in the Court of King's Bench, was a Deſign to ſtifle the Popiſh Plot; and that the Verdicts given thereupon were corrupt; and that the Judgments given thereupon were cruel and illegal. Do you get ſuch another Vote to juſtifie your Clemency and Tenderneſs, we will keep a Day for you, tho' through the Bleſſing of God we may never ſee your Face again; but if we ſhould, give me leave to tell you, that the old Window of the Banquetting Houſe ſtands in the ſame place where it did you know when. But leſt you or any of your curſed Crew ſhould ſay, That altho' I taſted not of your Grace, and Clemency, and Tenderneſs, yet ſtill your Clemency did appear to others that had offended you, this makes me haſten to ſome other Inſtances wherein the World may judge whether or no your Tender Mercies were not Cruelty in the higheſt degree.\n               2. Give me leave therefore to inſtance to you of the Uſage of the Duke of Monmouth, and thoſe Men that were with him in the Weſt, who did ryſe to have deliver'd the Nation from your Deſigns of Popery and Slavery, which you had for ſo many years with your Cut-throats carried on with ſuch Succeſs. That Noble Duke was your kind and loving Brother's Son, and your own Nephew, and one that for many years together had been very obſequious to you, and was, tho' ignorantly, in the Conſpiracy with you to ruine the Nation, and ventur'd his Life in that wicked War againſt the Dutch, to oblige you and his Father; but God had no ſooner open'd his Eyes, to make a true Judgment of your wicked purpoſes, but you ſought his Ruine, and took all Opportunities to be reveng'd upon him and his Party, which, you know, once was very conſiderable. And when God deliver'd him into your hand, you were pleas'd upon Tower-hill to murder him. This I ſay becauſe that he being a Peer of the Realm, notwithſtanding his pretended Attainder, he ought to have had the liberty of an attainded Peer, that is, to have been heard at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, and to have ſhew'd Cauſe why he ſhould not be executed according to the Tenure of that Act by which he ſtood attainded. But you, I conceive, was reſolv'd to have his Blood, and therefore you would not complement him with that piece of Juſtice which is due to every man that is found guilty of any capital Offence: So that he being deny'd of this piece of Juſtice, I do affirm, that he by your Clemency and Tenderneſs was baſely betray'd and murder'd.\nWell, did the buſineſs of the Weſt end ſo? No, for remember how many of them by your Villanous Kirk were murder'd and hang'd up in cool Blood, without any manner of proceeding according to the form of Law and Juſtice; and this being taken notice of by your own Crew, that had heard of your pretended Clemency and Tenderneſs, as a thing that would not ſound well in the\nNation; therefore the remainder were confined, and your Villain Jefferies and his murdering Brethren were ſent down to try theſe poor unfortunate wretches, from many of whom a Confeſſion was extorted upon the Promiſe of Pardon, and then they were condemn'd and murder'd, they being innocent of what they had confeſs'd againſt themſelves; others that had been in actual Arms hundreds of them were hang'd in the principal Towns, and their Quarters hang'd up in the Highways, as laſting Monuments of your Grace and Compaſſion.\n               And you being glutted with Blood, you then thought of other Puniſhments for ſome other of thoſe Offenders; many Men and Women were order'd to be whip'd publickly in the Market-Towns, others had their Eſtates ſeiz'd, and a great number were ſold into America, to ſerve all days of their Lives; ſo that there was nothing but the Voice of lamentation and weeping to be heard. In a word, your Grace, Clemency and Tenderneſs was ſuch, that ſeveral of the Weſtern Counties were made ſo many Fields of Blood and Butchery: Nay, Sir, thoſe who eſcaped your Mercy by vertue of your Proclamation, were forced to retire to the Woods and deſolate places, their neareſt and deareſt Relations not daring ſo much as to harbour or relieve them, ſo that ſeveral ſtarved to death, or periſh'd with cold for want of things neceſſary for the preſervation of Human Nature: Some fled to the Dutch for ſhelter, and were not only kindly receiv'd, but as civily entertain'd, till you began to have ſome Shame in you, and pardon'd ſome, in hopes that they would be of uſe to you; and others came over with the Prince of Orange, who, by the Juſt Judgment of God upon you and your Adherents, baniſh'd you the Kingdom, and the Lords and Commons of England depoſed you as uſeleſs to God and Man.\nBut, Sir, this is notorious, that you never entertain'd the leaſt Remorſe of Conſcience for the murther of theſe men in the Weſt, for thoſe you pardon'd paid a Price ſufficient for their Pardons; or if you gave them Pardon freely, it was to prevent their ſetting up their Trades in other Countries. And Jefferies your Tool, that you ought to have hang'd, you let him go off with no other Puniſhment than to be made Lord High Chancellor of England, who alſo did enrich himſelf with the Sum of 15000 l. extorted from one perſon who wanted a Pardon, for nothing elſe but the not delivering his Country, which he might have done for half the Mony. I am more ſorry that Jefferies got the Mony, than for that Gentleman's loſing that Sum. Truly, Sir, I was in hopes that the Time of that Villain Jefferies had been come, in which he ſhould not only have paid his Debt to Nature, but to his Faults too; but he is gone to his Place, and thereby he hath ſav'd the Hangman a Labour; but had he liv'd, he would in my opinion have been made an Example for all his Villanies that he had committed, both as a corrupt Judge and a trayterous Chancellor.\n3. You were pleaſed in the years 1687 & 1688, to publiſh a Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, and profeſſed in both the ſaid Declarations, That it was always your Judgment that no man's Conſcience ſhould be reſtrain'd in Matters of Religion. Now, Sir, if that were true, why then did you perſecute the Proteſtant Diſſenters for their Conſcience, from Feb. 6. 1684, till the latter end of the year 1686? And if it were not your Judgment, why then did you proclaim Liberty of Conſcience as your Judgment? But, Sir, to deal truly in the point, you had a Popiſh Fabrick to erect, and you wanted Liberty of Conſcience to be the Scaffold;\nand when you had done your buſineſs of ſettling Popery, you would have laid Liberty of Conſcience aſide, as your Brethren abroad of the Popiſh Religion have always done. And this was the Clemency your Brother was pleas'd to ſhew to Diſſenters, and afterwards he and you could with great Tenderneſs ſuffer them to periſh in Priſon; and you your ſelf, when you were in the Chair, perſecuted them, to the ruine of ſome Thouſands of Families; you ſurfeited your ſelf and Party with the murder and ruine of ſo many Men, and yet you pretend to Clemency and Tenderneſs. To conclude this particular, your Brother and you made two Declarations for Liberty of Conſcience, for no other intent but to cheat the People of England into Slavery and Popery, to the end that you might damn the Body and Soul of the Nation at once. From ſuch Clemency and Tenderneſs I truſt God hath deliver'd this Nation, and will preſerve her under the preſent Government, all your pretences to the contrary notwithſtanding.\n               4. What ſhall I ſay of thoſe worthy perſons that you kept in Jayl for the pretended Damages of 100000 l. and others of 10000 l. and others for one Fine or another? What ſhall I ſay of the Murther of the Lady Liſle, and Alderman Corniſh, Mr. Ayliff, and Mr. Nelthrope, and poor Diſney? Theſe were Monuments of your Clemency and Tenderneſs.\n3. You promis'd in your Speech to the Council, That you would maintain the Church of England as it was eſtabliſh'd by Law. Nay, I think, if you had not wrong done you, you ſwore it too at your Coronation. And, Sir, (if you pleaſe) call to mind how you kept your Promiſe and Oath in relation to the Church of England and the Proteſtant Intereſt; nay, you gave a reaſon for your Promiſe, it being the only Reaſon that you ever gave in your Life, I will put you in mind of it, Becauſe, ſaid you, Her Members had ſhew'd themſelves Loyal Subjects, and that the Principles of the Church of England had been for Monarchy. Therefore,\n1. How did you maintain the Church of England as by Law eſtabliſh'd? Were there not Laws in force for the preſervation of the Church of England, that had been enacted in the Reigns of ſeveral Princes that were your Predeceſſors, amongſt which Laws, as a ſecurity of the Church of England againſt Popery,\nThat all perſons whatſoever, that were advanced to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, or to bear Office in either Univerſity, as likewiſe all Civil and Military Officers, ſhould declare they were not Papiſts, but of the Proteſtant Religion, and that by taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and the Teſt; yet you and your Conſpirators annulled all thoſe Laws that were made to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion againſt Popery. Was this to defend the Church of England and to maintain Her Laws? I leave it to all men to judge. But you and your villanous Commiſſioners thought your ſelves ſo wiſe, as to reconcile Contradictions, and therefore you were reſolv'd to try your Skill upon the Church and the Nurſeries of Learning; which prov'd fatal to you and your Party by the Juſt Vengeance of Almighty God.\n2. Did you not, againſt expreſs Law, and againſt the Promiſe of your maintaining the Church of England, ſet up an Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion, and impower the Perſons named in that illegal Commiſſion to take cognizance, and to give arbitrary directions in matters Eccleſiaſtical, in which Commiſſion there was one who profeſs'd the Popiſh Religion, and others that were Abettors of Popery and Popiſh Superſtition; therefore to what deplorable condition was the Church of\nEngland reduc'd, that a Commiſſioner for the Church of England's Affairs ſhould publickly abjure the Proteſtant Religion, by which means he was not only very unfit, but alſo uncapable of holding any publick Employment! And did not the Banditti give you ſuch proof of their ſubmiſſion to your Popiſh Directions you gave them, that they had continued in their Places to this day, had not God of his Infinite Mercy deliver'd us from them and your ſelf? For they were men of an agreeable diſpoſition to have furthered your deſigns of Popery, notwithſtanding all your Promiſes to maintain the Church of England, for they took care that none ſhould be prefer'd that had any zeal for the Proteſtant Religion; for, if you will be ſerious in conſidering who they were that you prefer'd to the Dignities in the Church, and upon what terms, you muſt own, that they were men of ſuch Morals and Principles, as render'd them a very ſcandal to that villanous Deſign that you and your Conſpirators were carrying on againſt the Church of England.\n3. I pray, Sir, was the ſuſpenſion of the Biſhop of London another demonſtration of your Purpoſe and Reſolution to maintain the Church of England? Let any of your trayterous Crew ſtand forth and anſwer for you; Was not that Prelate ſuſpended for refuſing to obey an Arbitrary Order ſent to him by your Banditti Commiſſioners for the ſuſpending of Dr. Sharp, now Archbiſhop of York, for preaching againſt Popery according to his Office and Calling, without ſo much as citing the ſaid Dr. Sharp before him to make his defence, or obſerving any common forms of Proceſs commonly us'd in ſuch caſes: The Biſhop comply'd with your Suſpenſion, and what damage it was to him he can tell better than I; but it did work for our Good, and haſten'd our Deliverance, but it ſhew'd that you had but little regard to your Oath and Promiſe to maintain the Church of England.\n\n4. Another Specimen you gave us of your pious Reſolution of maintaining the Ch. of England as by Law eſtabliſh'd, was the dealing with Magdalen Colledge in Oxford. In the firſt place you turn'd out the Preſident, who was legally choſen by the Fellows of the Colledge, who, if I miſtake not, are ſworn to chuſe one from among themſelves to bear that Office; then you turn'd out all the Fellows for refuſing to chuſe one of your recommendation, without ſo much as citing them to appear before any Court that could take legal cognizance in that affair, or obtaining any Sentence againſt them by a competent Judge; and the only reaſon you gave for the turning them out, was, becauſe they had refus'd a perſon that was a Papiſt, who was not only uncapable by the Laws of the Land, but alſo by the Statutes of that Colledge, of bearing the Office of a Preſident or Fellow of that Community. And having expel'd both Preſident and Fellows, you put the ſaid Colledge into the hands of Papiſts, that you might the better maintain the Rights and Liberties of the Ch. of England as by Law eſtabliſh'd. But I hope it may be a warning to that Community, and to all others of that Univerſity, how they advance the Prerogative of the Crown ſo high, and nouriſh thoſe two peſtilent Doctrins of Paſſive Obedience and Non-Reſiſtance, and the Divine Right of Succeſſion, leſ\n•\n thoſe Doctrins do expoſe them to a greater Danger than the laſt.\n5. Another demonſtration that was given by you of your ſtedfaſt Purpoſes of ſtanding by and maintaining of the Ch. of England, was your proceeding againſt the Vice Chancellor of Cambridge, 1687. You had a great Favour for one Francis a Benedictine Monk, a Rogue that was fit for any Villany that you could put him upon to act; him you ſent to Cambridge to corrupt the Youth there, and no doubt\nbut for his time he did the buſineſs for which you ſent him. You planted him in Sidney Colledge, where you had placed one Baſſet a Papiſt in that Houſe as Maſter, but your Monk had an Apartment, wherein he perform'd the Office of a Prieſt according to the Ch. of Rome; but being a Fellow that had taken no Degrees in any Univerſity either at home or abroad, you were reſolv'd that he ſhould be a Maſter of Arts in the Univerſity of Cambridge; and in order to this you ſent a Letter to the ſaid Vice-Chancellor, to admit the ſaid Father Francis to be a Maſter of Arts without taking the Oaths; which the Vice-Chancellor refus'd, as contrary to the Law of the Land and the Statutes of the Univerſity: Upon this you caus'd the Vice-Chancellor and the Delegates of the Univerſity to be ſummoned before your Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, where that Villain Jefferies, contrary to all Law or Reaſon, pronounced Sentence, that the Vice-Chancellor being guilty of great Diſobedience to the King's Commands, and other Crimes and Contempts, ſhould be depriv'd of the Office of Vice-Chancellor, and ſuſpended of his headſhip of Magdalen Colledge in the ſaid Univerſity of Cambridge. Thus, Sir, you were pleas'd to maintain the Ch. of England, by ſuffering the Learning and Gravity of that Univerſity to be trampl'd upon, and by letting in a parcel of ſilly, impudent, and illiterate Popiſh Prieſts and Fryers, who were to joyn with you in ſupporting the Proteſtant Religion, as it was then by Law eſtabliſh'd. Unleſs your Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs judg'd that to deſtroy the two Univerſities as to Learning, and to break in upon their Laws made to preſerve their Communities, would be a means to preſerve the Church of England, I cannot but wonder at thoſe extravagant Proceedings in the laſt years of your Tyranny againſt them, ſince they had ſo highly eſpouſed your Cauſe when you were Duke of York, againſt the Sence of the whole Nation.\n               6. Another Reaſon you give us to believe that you did deſign to ſtand by and ſupport and maintain the Ch. of England, was your proceeding and cauſing to be ſummoned before your Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners all the Chancellors and Archdeacons of England, and requiring them to certifie the Names of thoſe Clergymen who had read the Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, as well as the Names of thoſe who had refuſed the ſame, without conſidering that the reading of it was not enjoyn'd the Clergy by the Biſhops, who are their Ordinaries: So that this was another way you intended (even by theſe extrajudicial Proceedings in your Court of Commiſſioners Eccleſiaſtical) to maintain the Liberties of the Ch. of England. This was one great cauſe why ſeveral Perſons of Quality both in Church and State refuſed to be concern'd in this Commiſſion, for they at laſt clearly ſaw, that this damnable Commiſſion tended to nothing leſs than the total Subverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, for you us'd it to no other end and purpoſe than to oppreſs ſuch perſons as were eminent for Learning and Virtue, that ſhould at any time or ſeaſon preach againſt Popery & Superſtition. And it was God's great Mercy to the Proteſtant Intereſt that they did at laſt ſee, for ſure I am that in the latter part of your Brother's time, and in the beginning of your time, they were given up to ſuch a ſecure ſtate, and judicial blindneſs, that the Proteſtant Religion was in greater danger of being ſuppreſt than ever it was ſince the Reformation, notwithſtanding your Promiſe of maintaining and preſerving it.\n7. Another Indication of your Care for the maintenance of the Ch. of England was the breaking thro' thoſe Laws which forbid the erecting Churches and Chappels\nfor the exerciſe of the Popiſh Religion, and alſo againſt Monaſteries and Convents, and more particularly againſt the Order of the Jeſuites; for you did, contrary to your Oath and Promiſe made to ſupport the Ch. of England, give out arbitrary and illegal Orders to erect Monaſteries; and in contempt of the Law you ſet up ſeveral Colledges of Jeſuites to corrupt the Youth of the Nation. Nay, Sir, that you might not leave your ſelf without Witneſs of your ſtedfaſt Reſolution of maintaining, ſupporting and defending the Ch. of England, you rais'd up a Jeſuite that was in the Popiſh Plot, in which the death of the King your kind and loving Brother was plotted and contriv'd, and the ſubverſion of the Government both in Church and State, to be a Privy Councillor and a Miniſter of State: By all which you did evidently ſhew, that you were reſtrain'd by no Laws, and therefore the Ch. of England muſt periſh, you being ſo well ſeconded in your Popiſh Progreſs by your moſt excellent Commiſſioners of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. But to conclude this Paragraph, how thoſe Villains that acted in that Commiſſion of yours can look Mankind in the Face, after they have done ſo many things againſt all Law, Honour and Conſcience, I do not underſtand: The truth is, thoſe that are yet alive have with the Whore in the Proverbs wiped their Mouths, and ſay, They have done no wickedneſs; and, without all doubt, if they might be truſted, would with as great earneſtneſs appear againſt your Cauſe and Intereſt, as they did wickedly in your time eſpouſe it; but they would be ſuch a Reproach to an honeſt Government, as would render the beſt and moſt honeſt Cauſe ſuſpicious, if engag'd in it.\n               IV. I come now to conſider a 4th Paſſage in your Speech to the Council, wherein you were pleas'd to ſay, That you had been reported to have been a man for Arbitrary Power, but you did aſſure them that you would preſerve the Government in Church and State, as by Law eſtabliſh'd; And That you knew that the Laws of England were ſufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as he could wiſh. How you preſerv'd the Government of the Church, is plain enough; nothing indeed is more plain than this, that you intended its Deſtruction and utter Subverſion, and that nothing leſs would ſerve your turn, notwithſtanding its Principles were for Monarchy, and its Members had ſhew'd themſelves Loyal Subjects. How fared it then with the State? Surely the Civil Government was preſerv'd, ſince the Laws of England were ſufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as he could wiſh: In truth, Sir, there was but a lamentable account to be given to your more than Glorious Succeſſor of your management of Affairs in the Civil Government, all things were out of order at his acceſſion to the Crown, which you may have forgotten; therefore, Sir, be pleas'd to remember, in the firſt place, your Villains of your Council, and of your Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion: As they were in a Conſpiracy againſt the Ch. of England, to turn our Religion into downright Popery, ſo they were in a Conſpiracy againſt the State, to turn the well eſtabliſh'd Government of this Land into downright Slavery, and this not ſecretly, as if thoſe Raſcals were not aſham'd of what they did, for they had that matchleſs Impudence to act in an open and undiſguis'd manner; and to carry on your villanous purpoſes, you and your Accomplices ſet up the Diſpenſing Power, by vertue of which you might ſuſpend and diſpenſe with the execution of the Laws at your pleaſure: and in order to give this deviliſh Maxim of yours and your Conſpirators countenance and credit, you ſo manag'd that matter, that you obtain'd an Opinion from the Judges, moſt of which were mercenary Rogues, who declar'd their opinion, That this Diſpenſing\nPower was in the Kings of England; as if it were in the power of theſe Villains to offer up the Laws and Liberties of the whole Nation to your ſelf, to be diſpos'd of by you arbitrarily at your pleaſure, and expreſly contrary to thoſe Laws that were enacted for the liberty of the Subject.\n               In order to obtain this Judgment, your Conſpirators did before hand examine ſecretly the Sentiments of the Judges, and procur'd ſuch of them as could not in Conſcience concur in ſo villanous an opinion or ſentence to be turn'd out, and others that had neither Law nor Conſcience were ſubſtituted in their rooms, ſo that by changing of hands they found out 12 matchleſs Rogues, from whom you obtain'd that wicked Judgment which, if my Memory fail me not, was laid down in theſe 5 particulars. 1. That the Kings of England are Soveraign Princes. 2. That the Laws of England are the King's Laws. 3. That it is an inſeparable Prerogative of the K. of Engl. to diſpenſe with Penal Laws upon neceſſity and urgent occaſions. 4. That the K. is the ſole Judge of that neceſſity. 5. That this is not in Truſt given to the K. but 'tis the ancient Remains of the Crown, which ne'r was nor can be taken from him. Give me leave, Sir, to examin theſe Particulars, and let the world ſee how you were abus'd, and how you abus'd the Government by the Opinions of theſe 12 mercenary Rogues.\n\n1. That the Kings of England were Soveraign Princes. What then? Muſt you by a Diſpenſing Power do what you liſt? were you not ſubject to thoſe Laws which you were ſworn to keep? And if you had not fled, might you not have been call'd to an account? Might not the People, from whom you deriv'd your Authority, have had any Power over you? And was it not dangerous both to Church and State to have a Popiſh Prince ſo mighty, that no Proteſtant Houſe of Peers or Commons dare controul him? Truly, Sir, I own that the Kings of England are ſoveraign Princes, yet the Nation by their Repreſentatives did ne'r allow the Kings of England to do what 12 mercenary Judges ſhould deliver as their Opinions; for, Sir, it was ne'r intended when you aſſumed the Government, that your Will and Pleaſure ſhould ſtand for a Law, for the Laws that ſupport the Grandeur of the Crown limited your Will to Reaſon, and ty'd your Commands to the Word of God, the Laws of the Realm, and the Weal of the People. And ſince, Sir, you regarded not theſe things, but follow'd the Sentiments of your corrupt Judges, your Will was unlawful, and Commands unjuſt.\nThe Kings of England always have been, and ſtill are Soveraign Princes, but what makes them ſo? Is it not the Law of the Land? And doth not the Law ſet a boundary to their Government as well as to the Peoples Obedience? Is there not a mutual Contract between King and People? Now, when any K. ſhall by a Suſpending or Diſpenſing Power diſſolve this Contract, and break in upon our Laws, and overturn the Government, the People ceaſe to be his Subjects, and he to be their King. It is your own caſe, Sir, by your Diſpenſing Power you did not only pretend to be above Law, but alſo that you were not bound by Law; tho' by your Oath you were as much bound to obſerve the Law as a King, as your People were bound to obſerve the Laws as your Subjects. But the People of England ſeeing that it was in vain to expect any Juſtice or Righteouſneſs from you, (for means of reformation was propounded, but was denied to be comply'd withal) ſeveral noble Lords ſaw themſelves ſlighted, their Counſels rejected, and the Proteſtant Religion upon its laſt Legs, they therefore did implore the help of the Prince of Orange, now our Gracious King; he comes over, ſeizeth your Treaſure, your fortified places, Navy, and Naval Stores, and with one Conſent of the People of England was made our Sove-L\n•\nrd and King, and hath his health very well without the help and aid of a Diſpenſing Power; God ſend him a long and proſperous Reign.\n\n2. The Laws of England are the Kings Laws; if your Diſpenſing Vermin did mean by the Laws being your Laws, that is, that you were intruſted with the Conſervation and the Execution of them, then we agree with the Rogues; but how doth this Truſt repoſed in the King, for the time being, intitle him to Suſpend and Diſpenſe with theſe Laws: but if by the Laws being yours they underſtood that they were your Property, either to Execute or not Execute, either to keep or break at your pleaſure: I pray Sir, to what end were they made, and to what end were you Sworn, to keep and maintain theſe Laws, why was there the trouble of an Oath to keep the Law? But Sir, here they laid down a notorious falſhood, for the Laws of England are the Laws made by King and People as the Rule of the Government of the King on the one hand, and of the Obedience of the People on the other.\n               3. That it is an inſeparable Prerogative of the King of England to Diſpenſe with Penal Laws upon neceſſity and urgent Occaſions, this was laid down as good Law. But Sir, I pray conſider, were not all the Laws of England Enacted by the King and the People of England, met in Parliament, for the ſecurity of the Government and of the Subject; how then could theſe Villains give you a Power of annulling theſe Laws at your Will and Pleaſure, ſince you could not ſuſpend or diſpenſe with them, but by the ſame Authority by which they were made? It is true, the King of England, for the time being, may pardon a Puniſhment that a Tranſgreſſor hath incurred, and to which he is condemned, as in caſes of Fellony and Treaſon, yet it cannot be inferred from hence, with any colour of reaſon, that you or any other King could intirely ſuſpend the Execution of thoſe Laws relating to Fellony or Treaſon, unleſs, Sir, your villainous Judges could have proved by any other Authority, than barely their Opinions that you were cloathed with a Diſpotick and Arbitrary Power, and that the Lives and Liberties, Honours and Eſtates of the People of England, did depend wholly upon your good Will and Pleaſure, and were intirely ſubject to you, which muſt infallibly follow on your having a Power to ſuſpend the Execution of the Laws, and to diſpence with them.\nIt may be Sir, ſome of your Diſpenſers may ſay, That you were not well informed when you took the Coronation-Oath to maintain the Laws of the Land, and that you had prejudiced your ſelf greatly by yielding to the Oath, and that you had weakened your Authority too much in ſubmitting your ſelf to the obſervation of thoſe Laws.\nTheſe things were much talked of by ſome of your Bully Conſpirators, when they little dreamed of your taking the Air at St. Germains: Nay, ſome of the Devils Brokers roared this out of their Pulpits by the direction of Old Hodge their guide. But, Sir, I pray, inform me how it could be that you ſhould not be well informed, when you yielded to take the Oath at your Coronation to obſerve, and keep the Laws of the Land? It is impoſſible that you ſhould be ignorant of that which all the World knew, and all your Predeceſſors before you; as it was almoſt impoſſible that you ſhould not be acquainted with the Oath that you were to take, and the Laws you were to preſerve by that Oath. So this, know that you were bound to thoſe Laws immediately upon taking the Oath; and I wonder much that you ſhould be a ſtranger to the Coronation Oath, and to the Laws by which you were\nto defend your Government that had been twenty four Years a looker on in the Reign of your Brother. Therefore this Plea is as frivilous, as the Opinion of your never to be forgiven Judges was Impudent and againſt Law. But this is one of the madeſt Thoughts that ever you, or your villainous Judges could be guilty of, that it was a blemiſh to the Sovereign Power of the Kings of England to ſubmit to the Laws. I pray, Sir, What blemiſh would it have been to your Sovereign Power to have ſubmitted to the Laws of your Countrey, which your Predeceſſors were contented to acknowledge and obſerve? You derived your Authority to your ſelf by virtue of the Laws? Why then was the Obſervation of the Laws ſuch a prejudice to you and your Sovereign Power? But we ſaw the Laws broken, and you forſworn, and your Subjects depoſed you. In this, I am ſure, you have found a greater blemiſh and prejudice, than the obſervation of the Laws would have been.\n               But to be ſhort, you may plead for your ſelf and your Judges, That were under a neceſſity and an urgent occaſion. Well, What was that neceſſity? What were thoſe urgent occaſions that could put you upon forſwearing your ſelf, and bringing your ſelf under the guilt of Perjury. In truth, Sir, your neceſſity you lay under, was the ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and bringing in Popery, and the ſubverſion of the Civil Government, and bringing in Tyranny and Slavery. Is not Perjury a moſt grievous Offence, but much more grievous when it is voluntarily committed? And then a King committeh Perjury willingly when he doth any thing willingly againſt the Oath he hath taken, not by force but by freewil, not unadviſedly but with great conſideration, not to his hurt but to his advantage, not to perform a thing that was impoſſible or diſhoneſt, but to bind himſelf to a condition that is honeſt and poſſible too. Now when a King breaketh ſuch an Oath, there can be no colour or pretence of neceſſity, or urgent occaſions to excuſe his Perjury.\n4. That the King of England is ſole Judge of that neceſſity. I never took you ſo much behind hand in Senſe and Reaſon, but that you might plainly ſee that this is but a bantre of theſe Rogues, for they neither ſtated the neceſſity and the urgent occaſions you had to forſwear your ſelf, and never inquired whether any neceſſity, or any urgent occaſions could excuſe you from lying under the guilt of Perjury. Then they came off with an impudent lye, and ſay the King is ſole Judge of that neceſſity. He is ſole Judge of nothing but what he is intitled to by the Law; where the Law makes him a ſole Judge there I do, and own my ſelf bound to obey him as ſuch. But once more, Sir, Where was this neceſſity of which you were to be ſole Judge? When did it ſpring? Out of what part of the World? I believe, if you could have convinced the Nation of this neceſſity, and theſe urgent occaſions, they would not ſo readily concurred to your going to St. Germains, were your Popiſh Friends oppreſſed. And did the neceſſity ariſe from thence? If it did, Why did you not tell the Parliament of this Oppreſſion? Were they in want of Places at Court, and Imployments under you, which they could not hold? Truly a great many Proteſtants went without them, notwithſtanding their being qualified. Oh! but the Prieſts of the Church of Rome were in danger of the Law. I never could yet ſee that day. If they would be quiet, and the Religion of the Church of Rome was your Religion: Well, if it was,\nHad you not better to have refuſed the Crown rather than to have taken it with ſuch Incumbrances and Clogs, as ſhould expoſe you to ſuch neceſſities and urgent occaſions of Perjuring your ſelf, and Damning your Soul, and Ruining of three Kingdoms? It was well you were the ſole Judge of the neceſſity; for if an honeſt Engliſh Parliament had ſat in the time of your neceſſity and urgent occaſions, they would have made theſe Rogues have ſwung for their villainous Advice.\n               5. That this is not in Truſt given to the King, but the Antient Remains of the Crown, which never was, nor can be taken from him; you, nor no King in England, ever had any thing but what you received in Truſt from the People of England in Parliament aſſembled, therefore this was the greateſt of Impudence that theſe Twelve ignorant Devils could be guilty of, for what Authority, Power, or Riches, have the Kings of England, but what they received from the People: and it is plain the Power and Authority that you received was for the benefit of the People, and not for the ruin and deſtruction of the Laws you conſented to; you were intruſted with the Conſervation of them, not to Suſpend, or Diſpenſe with them at your will and pleaſure.\nBut what King of England was there, ſince the pretended Conqeſt, that was not Sworn to keep the Laws, and defend the Rights and Liberties of the Church and People of England? and who Adminiſtred this Oath to them? but one or more, in the behalf of themſelves and all the People of England. Your Brother, though bad enough, took the Government as a truſt repoſed in him by his good People of England, what part was it then that was not a Truſt? they truſted him with vaſt ſums of money, they truſted you but with a very little. I pray Sir, would your Scoundril Conſpirators but tell me what parts were the Remains of the Crown, and how they came ſo to be; if they cannot it is all Cheat and Nonſence. By your management (notwithſtanding all that might have been ſaid to the contrary, even in your Reign, without the danger of being hanged,) you obtained from your Judges this wicked Opinion. I ſuppoſe you were not Idle, but was reſolved to proceed according to this Judgment of theirs; for you preſently invaded the Liberties both of Church and State. I have given you ſome inſtances of your Invaſion upon the Rights of the People of England, in relation to Matters of the Church. Now let us proceed to ſee how you carried your ſelf in reference to the Civil Rights and Liberties of the People of England, which brings me to a ſecond Inſtance of your invading our Civil Rights.\n2. As your Brother did begin, and made a very great Progreſs in, ſo you went on to invade Priviledges, and to ſeize the Charters of the Towns that had a right to be repreſented in Parliament; and by your Tools procured Surrenders of them to be made to you, eſpecially where they were poor, and not able to defend them. And a Gentleman that valued himſelf upon his Oath that he had made to a Corporation, whereof he was a Magiſtrate, and therefore refuſed to deliver the ſame; you rewarded him with a two or three years impriſonment, and had not God interpoſed, it had been to the ruin of himſelf, his Wife and Children. By theſe Surrenders, Sir, you cauſed all the Magiſtrates to give up\ntheir Rights and Priviledges, to be diſpoſed of at your pleaſure, and the pleaſure of your Villains the Conſpirators; and by this means you placed in ſeveral of theſe Towns Popiſh Magiſtrates, notwithſtanding their incapacity, or ſuch as were Popiſhly affected, and willing to concur with you in all your evil Deſigns and Purpoſes, aſſuring your ſelf, that when neceſſity, or your urgent Occaſions ſhould force you to call a Parliament, you might have ſuch a Parliament returned as ſhould at once ſet up Popery and Arbitrary Power. Nay, Sir, our danger in your time, and in the time of your loving and kind Brother, did moſt (and doth ſtill) ariſe from thoſe Beggarly and Paltry Borroughs that either are by Charter or Preſcription enabled to ſend Members to Parliament.\n               3. That you might not fail in the Counties of obtaining your wicked ends, you gave Orders to Examin all Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, and all other that were in any Publick Employments, if they would Concur with you in the Repealing the Teſt and Penal Laws; and thoſe whoſe Conſciences would not permit them to comply with your wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes were turned out, and others who you found would be more compliant to you in your intentions, in defeating the End and Execution of thoſe Laws which had been made with ſo much Care and Caution, to preſerve not only the Proteſtant Religion, but alſo our Civil Rights and Liberties; and into many of thoſe places you put in Papiſts, and other perſons of Arbitrary Principles; notwithſtanding the Law had incapacitated the former, and the other for want of Reputation and Intereſt could do their Country but little Service; unleſs, like Devils, they could do miſchief by ſerving your Deſigns, and the Purpoſes of your Conſpirators: ſo that this Nation was in a deplorable Condition, and muſt have periſhed had not God raiſed up the Prince of Orange, now our King, to come over and deliver us out of your Hands.\n4. As your Brother in his time hated the Peoples Petitioning him for the redreſs of their Grievances, and had a Set of Men ready to Abhor and Deteſt ſuch Popular Petitions, though it was the Subjects Right to Petition the King for the redreſs of Grievances, under which they groaned in his Reign. So you was pleaſed to ſhew your averſneſs to Petitioning; witneſs your proceeding againſt the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and the other Biſhops, who offered a moſt humble Petition to you in terms full of Reſpect, and exceeded not the number limited by Law, in which they ſet forth their Reaſons for which they could not obey a certain Order; which you, by the Advice of your Popiſh Villains, ſent them to appoint their Clergy to Read in their Chruches, the Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, they were ſent to Priſon; and afterwards brought to a Tryal, as if they had been guilty of ſome enormous Crime, they were not only obliged to defend themſelves under this Perſecution; but alſo to appear before four Villains, one Profeſſed Papiſt, and the other three had not taken the Teſt, and by Conſequence were Men whoſe Intereſt and Inclination too led them to Condemn them. And the Judges that gave their Opinion in favour of thoſe Prelates were turned out; thus you may ſee a fourth Inſtance you have given us of your invading our Civil Rights.\n\nBut, Sir, while I ſpeak to you of theſe things, give me leave to plead with you, What King was there that ever reigned that was too great to be petitioned by the meaneſt of his Subjects? It cannot be pretended that any Kings how great ſoever their Power hath been, and how Arbitrary and Diſpotick they have been in the exerciſe of this Power, have ever reckoned it a Crime for their Subjects to come with all ſubmiſſion and reſpect, in a due number, not exceeding the limits of the Law, to repreſent Reaſons why they could not execute ſuch, or ſuch an Order. Deal freely with the World, ſend to your Diſpenſing Rogues, and ask them whether it were one of the remains of the Crown that impowered you to wreſt out of the Hands of the Subject this undoubted Right of Petitioning the Prince for theredreſs of Grieveances?\n               5. How did you treat a Peer of this Realm? Was he not uſed by you, and your villanious Conſpirators as a Criminal, only becauſe he ſaid, That the Subjects were not bound to obey the Orders of a Popiſh Juſtice of the Peace? Tho it was evident that ſuch being by Law rendred uncapable of all ſuch Truſts: No regard was due to any of their Orders. This being the ſecurity which the People of England had, and ſtill have by the Law, for their Lives, Liberties, Honours and Eſtates, that they are not ſubjected to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Papiſts, that were contrary to Law put into any Imployment Civil or Military. This was another inſtance of the invaſion you made upon us, in reſpect of our Civil Rights and Liberties, and manifeſted your ſelf to be a Man for Arbitrary Government in ſubjecting our Perſons and Eſtates to the Arbitrary Proceedings of Popiſh Magiſtrates and Officers under you.\n6. You apprehending that the great Remedy of your Grievances, and Security of our Religion was a Free Parliament; and leaſt you might lie under a neceſſity of calling one, you and your Accomplices did endeavour to make it impoſſible, or at leaſt very difficult to be obtained; for you could not but apprehend that a Lawful Parliament being once Aſſembled, would call you and your Villains to an account for all your open Violations of the Law, and for your Plots and Conſpiracies againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of the People of England, you endeavoured, under the ſpecious pretence of Liberty of Conſcience, firſt to ſow Diviſions between the Proteſtants of the Church of England, and Proteſtant Diſſenters; the Deſign being laid to engage all Proteſtants that are equally concerned to preſerve themſelves from Popiſh Oppreſſion into mutual Quarrellings. So that by theſe ſome Advantages might be taken by you to bring about your Villainous Deſigns and Purpoſes, and that both in the Election of Members of Parliament, and afterwards in the Parliament it ſelf; for you could not but ſee, that if all Proteſtants did enter into a mutual good underſtanding one with another, and concur together in the preſerving our Civil Rights and Liberties, that it would have been poſſible for you and your Banditti to accompliſh your wicked Ends. What could we expect from you, when you ſtruck at the Foundation of all our Civil Rights and Liberties, in the hindring the Nation of the Choice of a Free and Lawful Parliament? For did you not require all Perſons, in the ſeveral Counties of England, that either were in any Imployment, or were in any conſiderable Eſteem, to declare before hand that they would concur\nin the repeal of the Teſt and the Penal Laws, and that they would give their Voices in the Elections to Parliament, only for ſuch as would concur in it? ſuch as would not thus pre-engage themſelves were turned out of all Imployments, and others who entred into theſe Engagements were put into their Places; many of which are Papiſts, and contrary to the Charters and Priviledges of thoſe Burroughs, that have a right to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament. You ordered ſuch Regulations to be made as you thought fit and neceſſary for the aſſuring your ſelf, and your villainous Conſpirators, of all the Members that were to be choſen by thoſe Corporations; and by this means you gave your ſelf, and Tribe, hope to avoid the being called to an account for your Villanies: though it was then, and is ſtill apparent that all Acts made by Popiſh Magiſtrates are Null and Void of themſelves; ſo that no Parliament could have been lawful, for which Elections and Returns had been made by your Popiſh Sheriffs, and Mayors of Towns; and therefore, as long as the Authority and Magiſtracy was in ſuch Hands, it was impoſſible for us to have had a Lawful and a Free Parliament.\n               You might have known that the Conſtitution of the Engliſh Government and Cuſtom, time out of mind. All Elections of Parliament Men ought to be made with an intire Liberty, without any ſort of force, or the requiring the Electors to chooſe ſuch perſons as ſhould be named to them; and the perſons thus freely Elected ought to give their Opinions freely upon all Matters that are brought before them, they having the good of the Nation before their Eyes, and following in all things the dictates of their Conſciences. Therefore you having uſurped an illegal Authority, and reſolving upon the utmoſt Violations of our Laws, you would not give us the leaſt hopes of having our Grievances redreſſed by a Free Parliament legally called and choſen.\nIt is true, you would have called one in which all Elections ſhould have been carried by Fraud and Force, and might have been compoſed of ſuch perſons of whom you and your Trayterous Crew would have been well aſſured, in which all things would have been carried on by their Direction and Intereſt, without any regard to the Good and Welfare of this Nation, which I prove to you and your Villainous Crew, both at home and abroad. For did you not try the Members of the pack'd Parliament, that ſat down in the Year 1685, to gain them to conſent to the repeal of the Teſt and Penal Laws? And did you not diſſolve that Parliament when you found that you could neither by Promiſes, nor by Threatnings prevail with theſe very Members to comply with your wicked Deſigns; and thoſe who would not comply were branded, as if they were Diſturbers of the publick Peace? For you may remember, that though the Prince and Princeſs of Orange did endeavour to ſignifie in terms full of Reſpects and Duty to your ſelf, the juſt and deep regret all your wicked and ungodly Proceedings had given them; and in compliance to your deſires they had ſignified their Thoughts concerning your Repealing the Penal Laws and Teſt, which though they did it in ſuch a manner that they had juſt Ground of hope, that they had propoſed an Expedient by which the Peace of England, Scotland and Ireland, and a happy Agreement among the Subjects of all Perſwaſions might have been certainly\nſettled. You and your Hellborn Crew put ſuch Villainous Conſtructions upon their honeſt and ſincere Intentions, as that you were not aſhamed to condemn them both as perſons that deſigned to diſturb the Quiet and Happineſs of the Kingdom. But, Sir, the people of England always Teſtified a moſt ſingular Affection and Eſteem for the Prince and Princeſs of Orange, as perſons zealouſly Affected with, and concerned for the Advancement of the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt; and therefore many of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and many Gentlemen, and other perſons of Note, laid our miſerable Caſe before them, and beged their Aid and Aſſiſtance. The Prince of Orange upon due conſideration of our deplorable State, to which we were brought by you and your wicked Accomplices, found that in point of that Duty he owed to God, and in return of the great Value the people of England had for him, that he could no way excuſe himſelf from eſpouſing our Cauſe or Quarrel in a Matter of ſuch high Conſequence, and from Contributing to the utmoſt of his Power, for the maintaining both of our Religion, and our Laws, and our Liberties, and to ſecure us in the perpetual Enjoyment of all our Rights. Therefore he came over with a Force ſufficient, which through the Bleſſing of the Great God, was ſufficient to ſuppreſs you and your villainous Conſpirators.\n               You know, Sir, that as you and your Conſpirators were not only full of Cruelty, and Guilty of the greateſt Inhumanities and Barbarities. So you and they were full of lies and deceit; for upon the coming over of this Great Prince, you were ſenſible of the Greatneſs of your Guilt, and had no great Confidence in your own Forces, which induced you to offer to the City of London ſome ſeeming Relief from their great Oppreſſion, you hoping thereby to beguile us of a firm Eſtabliſhment, and full Security of our Laws, Liberties, and Religion; and finding that the Kingdoms Eyes were fully opened, then you and your Hellborn Crew gave out, with as much Mallice as Falſeneſs, that the Prince of Orange intended to Conquer and Enſlave the Nation. No, Sir, the Deſign of that mighty Deliverer was the ſecurity of our enjoying our Religion, Laws and Liberties, and that there might be no danger of the Kingdoms relapſing into the like Miſeries for the time to come.\nWell, Sir, you remember that the Prince arrives and you fled before him. He no ſooner comes but he was bid welcome by all True Proteſtants. You run away. A Convention was called, and he, to our great Joy, was choſen our King. A Parliament ſits down, and his Majeſty joyned with them in making ſuch Laws, as have ſecured us and our All; he Fights our Battles; he Loves our Nation; and we Love our King, and we ſhall not refuſe any thing that may be for his Honour, Greatneſs, and Content. You are depoſed as uſeleſs in the ſight of God, and driven from amongſt Proteſtants to graze at St. Germains, where you may take your eaſe till the French King ſhall be as weary of your Company, as we were of your Wicked and Tyrannical Government. You have made many attempts to be reſtored; ſometimes you Threaten us, at other times you would Flatter us to a ſecond Entertainment; but that is but a fooliſh thought of your Counſellers at St. Germains, which brings me to the laſt point of my Memorial, which is to ſhew you,\n\n3. The Unreaſonableneſs of your attempting of your Return hither, on which particulars I hope you have leiſure enough to reflect, and to adviſe about with your worthy Miniſtry you have attending your Perſon there; but leaſt they ſhould not have Honour and Honeſty enough to deal plainly with you, I will lay down Six undeniable Arguments, why it is morally impoſſible that you ſhould be ever readmitted to reign over us. 1. Becauſe we cannot bind you by the moſt Solemn Oaths. 2. Becauſe we are Proteſtants. 3. Becauſe we are Engliſh-men. And, 4. Becauſe we are Free-men. 5. Becauſe we have a King of our own Religion and Judgment, to whom we have ſworn Allegiance, who goeth out and in before us, and fights our Battles for us. 6. Becauſe of your Attempt upon the Perſon of our King, in employing your Traiterous Aſſaſſins to murder him.\n               1. Becauſe we cannot bind you by the moſt Solemn Oaths; we ſaw our Laws over-turned, our Liberties ſeized, our Religion corrupted and ſubverted, and you Forſworn: The Laws of Nature taught us to provide for the defence of our All which was at Stake. And can any Man think it hard that the Kingdom laid you aſide? And we laying you aſide for the Breach of your Contract and Oath, made to the People of England; Can you expect that we ſhould in the leaſt be guilty of ſo baſe a Compliance, as to ſubmit our ſelves to the Government of a Man, that by his Abominable Perjury diſſolved his own Government? You have time now to conſider that Perjury in a King is a moſt Grievous Offence againſt God and his Own Crown and Dignity, but much more Grievous when it is volantarily committed: And when a Prince committeth Perjury willingly, when he doth any thing willingly againſt his Coronation-Oath, taken not by Force, but by Free-will, not unadviſedly, but with great Conſideration, not to his Hurt, but to his Advantage, not to perform a Thing Diſhoneſt or Impoſſible, but that which is both Poſſible and Honeſt: For when a Prince (not being forced thereunto by juſt Fear or irriſiſtible Neceſſity) breaketh ſuch an Oath as there can be no colour to excuſe his Perjury, it arguing him and convincing him of Fraud and Deceit, and gave occaſion to all thinking Men that you had no manner of regard to your Coronation-Oath; ſo it puts you under an abſolute Incapacity of being Reſtored, ſince the both Houſes of Parliament, upon the breach you made of your Contract, have thought fit to lay you aſide, as a Perſon uſeleſs and dangerous to the publick Weal of the Three Kingdoms. Your Pretences therefore to the Imperial Crown of this Realm are very fooliſh and frivolous, for by the Laws of all Nations, you having been guilty of the moſt notorious Perjury, you are therefore Infamous; and the Laws of your own Synagogue ſay that no Infamous Perſon is fit for the Execution of an Office of Honour and Dignity; a perjured Man is always repelled from bearing witneſs in any Cauſe whatſoever, becauſe that being Convicted to have Forſworn himſelf in one Cauſe, it is not only a Preſumption, but a ſufficient Proof that he will Depoſe falſly in another: And this is ſo true, that altho he hath amended his Life yet he cannot be admitted for a Witneſs be it either in a Civil or a Criminal Cauſe. So, Sir, you having once Forſworn your Self in ſubverting our Religion, Laws and Liberties, by the advice of a parcel of Men that feared not God, nor reverenced Men: How do you think that we can ever truſt you again? For if the Nation ſhould be brought under\nſuch diſmal and deplorable Circumſtances, (which God avert) as once more to ſubmit to your Adminiſtration of the Government; it would not only be a ſtrong preſumptive Concluſion, but Proof that admits of no Objection that you would run again into the ſame Enormities, if not worſe; for I fear, and ſo do all True Proteſtants, that by your Crew that you have with you, you are poſſeſſed with ſtrange and very vile Opinions: And theſe are ſuch as have not only in times paſt, but are ſtill entertained by you, and your villainous Conſpirators both at home and abroad, about the Coronation Oath which you took when you entered upon the Adminiſtration of the Government of this Realm. And they are theſe Four, 1. That Subjects cannot receive an Oath of their Prince without the Authority of ſome Judge; and that a Promiſe made before no competent Judge can bind any Man, much leſs a Prince; and they have affirmed that this was your Caſe. I would have you remember, Sir, that he that adminiſtred you the Oath was a lawful and competent Judge, becauſe that Law and the Cuſtom of the Realm had made him ſo; and therefore to him you Swore, and in Swearing to him you Swore to the whole Nation that you would defend their Laws and Liberties. In a word, this Coronation Oath you took was a lawful Oath, and not only ſo but it was lawfully taken, as well becauſe general Cuſtom hath the force and ſtrength of a Law; for the perſons preſent do ſtand, and are taken by general Cuſtom to have Power to give and receive that Oath. But a bold Aſſertor of your Cauſe was pleaſed once to tell me that there was no Parliament in being when you took this Oath; What then? When you took the Coronation Oath there were perſons (who upon your taking the Oath) that did take the Oath of Fealty and Homage to you in the behalf of themſelves, and all the Nobility, and Commons of England; and this Oath muſt avail them though abſent, as though they were preſent; and if they were to be bound by the one though abſent, then certainly you were bound by yours though they were not preſent.\n               2. Theſe wicked Conſpirators of yours have Aſſerted, That Princes being above the Law are not bound to obſerve Oaths and Contracts, which have their full force and ſtrength from the Law; and that Princes may alter and change their own Laws at their Pleaſure. This Doctrine was carefully propogated by your truſty Roger and his inferiour Clergy by your Direction, in order to bring about that wicked Deſign of yours of Subverting of the well eſtabliſhed Government of this Realm, and introducing French Slavery. But, Sir, this you muſt now know that the Princes of England are not above the Law, and therefore cannot alter them at their Pleaſure without the manifeſt breach of their Coronation Oath. I confeſs, they may by their Judges interpret the Law in an Interval of Parliament, and in time of Parliaments: The Parliament are the beſt interpreters of the Law, and not only ſo but the Kings of England by and with the advice and conſent of Parliament, and by the Authority of the ſame, may Repeal and Abrogate Laws as they ſhall think fit. But what you did was againſt Laws in force, to the manifeſt breach of your Oath, and you rendered your ſelf odious to God, and diſpenced with thoſe Laws that were for the preſervation of Perſons, Honours, Eſtates, and Religion of the People of England; and by\nthis means you diſſolved the Government, and for which Cauſe you were hated of the People; and at laſt the Kingdom departed from you; you provoked that God that made you a Man, and that People that made you a King.\n               But, Sir, your truſty Guide Hodge, with his inferiour Clergy, deceived you much, and thoſe who believed this Doctrine, when they taught that your Oaths made to, and contract made with the People of England, had their full force and ſtrength from the Law of the Land; for they had their ſtrength and force from the Law of Nature which binds Kings, Princes, Lords, Prieſts, and all Men whatever. Therefore, Sir, did you not againſt the very Laws of Nature break your Contract with the People of England, and the Oath you made to them? Doth not the Law of Nature oblige all Princes to keep their Contracts even with their Enemies? How much more ought you to have kept your Contract with your Friends and People? How could you expect to wear the Name of an honeſt Man, ſince that the Laws of Honeſty charge Princes to keep their Oaths and Contracts? There is nothing becomes them better, nothing commendeth them more, and nothing that Men require ſo much at their hands.\nIn the laſt place, Princes Oaths to, and Contracts with their Subjects and Allies, are as good as Laws, they have the ſame force as Laws, they have the ſame ſtrength and vertue againſt their Succeſſours which they have againſt themſelves; nay, let me tell you, that they are of greater ſtrength than Princes Laws; for Laws may be Repealed, but Contracts can never be Revoked; and why ſo? The Reaſon is plain, That Laws may alter according to the neceſſity of Affairs, but Contracts and Oaths can never be Revoked, they admit of no Change, no Alteration; if once perfected they can neither receive Addition, Subſtraction, Diminution, or Enlargement, they muſt not be wreſted but taken according to the true meaning of King and People. But, Sir, you may ſay, Why may not Princes break their Oaths, and diſſolve their Contracts made with their Subjects at their Coronation? To this I give you this Anſwer.\nBefore you had Sworn to maintain our Laws, Liberties and Religion, you were free; and before you made a Covenant with us, you were at your liberty: But when you had Sworn, and when you had perfected your Contract, then of neceſſity you were bound to keep and perform them; and you could not have added to, or detracted from any thing in ſuch a manner perfected, without the conſent of the people with whom you made this Contract; for we were to have been benefited by this Oath and Contract of yours, and not deceived again. If Princes may break their Oaths and Contracts made to, and with their Subjects, How can we deal with ſuch a King? How can we tell when we obey? We muſt be then at great uncertainties, and ſo by conſequenue we cannot be ſafe. Furthermore, Did it not lye at your door to have preſerved your ſelf from Scandal and Fraud? Of which you took no care; therefore you made no Conſcience of of your Oaths and Contracts. Again, Sir, we muſt ſuppoſe you to be a reaſonable Creature; and if ſo, we muſt alſo conclude you ought to have ſubmitted to Reaſon, that you might have, at leaſt have had the reputation of a Man, and not be ſignalized with the Character of a filthy Monſtrous Beaſt. Hence it is that Tyrants, in ſacred Writ, are called Beaſts, becauſe they will not ſubmit to,\nnor be governed by the Rules of right Reaſon. In the laſt place, Sir, other Men may in their Oaths and Contracts have an Eye to their Profit, but you ought to have had an Eye to your Honour, and to have had an eſpecial regard thereof. Now what can be more Diſhonourable in a King, than to break his Word, falſifie his Faith, and violate his Contract? And was not your Word, Faith and Contract confirmed by a ſolemn Oath?\n               3. There was a third Doctrine that was much promoted by your Conſpirators, that although Kings ſhould be ſtrictly bound to ſtand to their Contracts and their Oaths; yet if they were induced to make a Contract, and to take an Oath in things wherein they were not well informed, or if the Contract and Oath do contain things too much derogating, or diminiſhing their Juriſdiction or Authority Royal, or if they have made a Promiſe that may be prejudicial to their Greatneſs, they may then lawfully break their Contract, Faith and Oath.\nThis Doctrine was very induſtriouſly ſpread about by your Party, eſpecially by your Jeſuits and your Jeſuited Papiſts, and Paſſive Obedience Men. But certainly, Sir, your Conſpirators repreſented your underſtanding to be but of Iriſh Standard, and to be of the ſame Scantling with their Honeſty. Give me leave to ask you this one fair Queſtion, Was you not well informed what you were to do, and what you did promiſe to do when you took the Coronation Oath to defend the Proteſtant Religion, and preſerve and maintain the Laws of the Realm, and by them to govern this great People you took the Charge of? Can any Man think, Sir, that you ſhould be the only Man that was Ignorant of that which all the Nation knew, and what your Grand-father, Father and Brother had done before you? Where, Sir, was the Diſhonour or Blemiſh that might fall upon you, if you had kept your Oath, and made the Laws of the Land the Rule of your Government? If you had been a good King, you would have delighted to have been bound by the Laws of the Land, and have rejoyced the Hearts of the People of England; and then you would not have at this time have been obliged to France for your Subſiſtance.\nBut, Sir, God in his juſt Judgment gave you up to believe theſe lies, and therefore you violated thoſe Laws by which you were Sworn to govern, to gratifie your Popiſh Hellborn Crew; they have got you to themſelves. We have a King that thinks it no Blemiſh to his Regal Authority, to maintain and keep our Laws, he judges it no Diſhonour to preſerve the Liberties of his People, and their Honours and Eſtates: You have the reward of your Unrighteouſneſs, I wiſh you much Joy of it.\n4. Some of the Doctors and Caſuiſts of your Synagogue of Rome ſay, that Princes who may diſpenſe with others may give a ſufficient Diſpenſation to themſelves, and ſo revoke their Contracts and break their Oaths; for that they have Might, and Power, and Authority; there is no Law, no Judge that can compel them to keep their Oaths, and obſerve their Contracts.\nIt is manifeſt that you did take upon you to diſpenſe with others, and to give your ſelf a Diſpenſation too; and we own that we were not then in a Condition to call you to an Account; but you were Admoniſhed very often by the beſt and greateſt of your Subjects, to reform all that was amiſs: But after all this\nAdmonition, you did remain incorrigible; then what could we do but make your Actions, Cruelties and Tyrannies, and Perjury known to the World. And we implored the Aid and Help not of the French King, but William Prince of Orange, who came and ſuppreſſed you as an incorrigible Oppreſſor and Tyrant. And your Party appearing bare-faced to murther our King, and invade the Kingdom with a Foreign Force, in order to enſlave us, will be treated as Villains and Common Rogues, and receive the juſt recompence of Reward for all their Treaſonable Conſpiracies againſt our King, and the well eſtabliſhed Government of the Kingdom, and the Proteſtant Religion.\n               To conclude this point, How deteſtable and odious hath your Perjury made you, it hath excluded you from that great Honour to which you arrived, and it hath removed you from your native Country; in a word it hath clothed you with ſo much infamy, that it is impoſſible for you to attain that Honour, Power and Authority, and Majeſty you have loſt? And therefore it is highly unreaſonable for you, or your Conſpirators ever to attempt your Reſtauration.\n2. As your Perjur is an argument why it is not only impoſſible for you to be reſtored, and folly for you to attempt it, ſo in the ſecond place we are Proteſtants; And what can a Popiſh Apoſtate do at the head of a Proteſtant Intereſt? The Popiſh Queen Mary ſhe no ſooner obtained the Crown, by a Proteſtant Intereſt, but ſhe deſtroyed that very Intereſt by which ſhe was advanced to the Throne. This we well remember, Sir; and we need not burn our Fingers again the third time. Suppoſe, Sir, that we ſhould have ſo little ſenſe as to try you once more, and ſhould ſucceed; What Monſters muſt we appear to the World, a Body of Proteſtants with a Popiſh Head? This doth much aſtoniſh me, that our little Prick-ear'd Prieſts of the Church of England have ſo much admired your Cauſe, and pleaded it with ſuch earneſtneſs; when as they cannot but conclude that you muſt of neceſſity deal by the Church of England, as you would with an impudent Harlot. Your Brother was careleſs in the maintenance of our Religion, becauſe he was a Papiſt, though a looſe one: And can we otherwiſe conclude but you who have at all times, and in all places whereever you have come, ſhewed your ſelf a bigotted Papiſt, will not only diſcountenance the Proteſtant Religion, but deſtroy it with all that Zeal that is conſiſtent with the Principles of a perverſe Member of the Romiſh Synagogue. You in the time of your ſhort Tyranny made a ſad Havock with the Proteſtant Religion; and can we expect better uſuage from you, ſeeing you having Seven Devils more within you rageing againſt the Proteſtant Intereſt than you had before you left us.\nWhat I ſay to you in this particular, I ſpeak not without Witneſs, for it is moſt certain that you have, and do to this very day entertain a very great averſneſs to any Man that bears the name of a Proteſtant. Therefore ſince by your late behaviour, to thoſe whoſe Principles have led them to eſpouſe your Intereſt, and have followed you into France, if they have any Senſe of their Engliſh Liberties, and of the Proteſtant Religion, will abhor the thoughts of your return hither: For if you appear ſo violent againſt our Religion now you are under ſo great an eſtate of Sufferings; What will your declared Hatred be againſt Proteſtants here in England, if we ſhould admit you to reign over us? For if\nyou can preſume to that degree of Malice, as to deny your Proteſtant Tools your Grace and Favour at St. Germains; What can we that are Proteſtants expect from you whenever you ſhall return? Do you think that any of us ſhould be ſo ſtupid to expect fair Quarter from you, ſince your very Religion lays you under the neceſſity of Converting us with a Fagot, and bringing us to your Obedience with the dint of a Dagger? Nay, Sir, your Paſſive Obedience Curs fare not much better, though they ſaved you from your being proſecuted for your being deeply intereſted in the Popiſh Plot, and from being excluded from the Succeſſion to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, and alſo from being beaten out of the Kingdom by the late Duke of MONMOƲTH. What reaſon than have we not to believe that you will not only in general invade the Proteſtant Religion, but alſo once again attempt the depreſſing the Church of England? In your ſhort Reign you ſent Seven Biſhops to the Tower; but if ever you ſhould return I will not excuſe the whole Twenty Six from being more hardly uſed. Upon which conſideration I will appeal then, Sir, to your Judgment, or the Judgment of your Friends here, or thoſe with you at St. Germains, whether or no it is impoſſible for you to gain ſo great a Point as to be received again as a King? And whether it would not be the greateſt Folly or Madneſs in you, or any of your Party to attempt it? For have you any that are with you, that are Proteſtants, upon a Principle of Conſcience, How have you uſed and treated them (and if they have no better uſage from you ſince they follow you in their Afflictions, and are contented to ſhare with you in your Hardſhips) as not to enjoy the Liberty of ſerving God according to their Dictates of their own Conſcience? How muſt it fare with them if you ſhould arrive to that State and Condition, in which you ſhould ſtand in no need of them? And if ſo, What can we expect from you that have hated your Perſon, and do hunt down your Cauſe and Intereſt out of the Nation? Therefore the Duty that we owe to Almighty God, and the Affection and Zeal we have for the Proteſtant Religion, will oblige us to purſue you as a Murderer, and an Aſſaſſin of the People of England, and a Traytor to the Nation; and thoſe who ſhall be found fighting under your Banner will be uſed as Banditti and Robbers, and Proteſtants that ſhall not have the benefit of Repentance.\n               3. Conſider we are Engliſh Men; and that very Conſideration might ſatisfie any Man that will but conſult his Reaſon of the impoſſibility of your being reſtored to your pretended Right, and of the folly of your many attempt, in order thereunto. Had your Intereſt been an Engliſh intereſt, than your Conſpirators might have had ſome colour for their attempt of this Nature; but your Intereſt is a French Interſt, and therefore your Intereſt that you have eſpouſed is incompatible, or inconſiſtent with your being reſtored. Here are two Points that muſt be conſidered. 1. That your Intereſt is a French Intereſt. 2. That a French Intereſt is not conſiſtent with your Endeavours after a Reſtoration; and both theſe Points fairly proved will juſtifie the refuſal of the Kingdom of Englands admitting you to act, and execute the Office of a King here again amongſt us.\n\n1. Your Intereſt is not an Engliſh but a French Intereſt; for as you followed your loving and kind Brother in moſt of his Vertues, ſo you perſued the ſame Intereſt that he purſued: For was not the Intereſt of your Brother, and the Intereſt of the French King and yours inſeperably united? Knowing (ſaith your Quondam Secretary) the Intereſt of our King, and in a more particular manner of my immediate Maſter the Duke, and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to be ſo inſeperably united; that it was impoſſible to divide them without deſtroying them all. Again his Majeſty [the French King] was pleaſed to give Order to ſignifie to his R. H. my Maſter, that his Majeſty was fully ſatisfied of his R. H's good Intentions towards him, and that he eſteemed both their Intereſts but as one and the ſame, and that my Lord Arlington and the Parliament were both looked upon as very unuſeful to their Intereſts. And again Father Ferier begged his R. H. to propoſe to his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty what he thought neceſſary for his own Concern, and the advantage of Religion; and his Majeſty would certainly do all that he could to advance both, or either of them.—I communicated it to his R. H. to which his R. H. commanded me to anſwer, as I did the 29th of the ſame Month. That his R. H. was very ſenſible of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Friendſhip, and that he would labour to cultivate it with all the good Offices he was capable of doing his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. That he was fully convinced that their Intereſts were both one. That my Lord Arlington and the Parliament were not only unuſeful, but dangerous both to England and France, and therefore it was neceſſary they ſhould do all they could to diſſolve it.—I did communicate this Deſign of mine to Monſieur Ravigney, who agreed with me that it would be the greateſt Advantage to his Maſter, to have the Duke's Power and Credit ſo far Advanced.—Again, If we can advance the Duke's Intereſt one ſtep forward, we ſhall put him out of the reach of Chance for ever.—Then would Catholicks be at reſt, and his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Intereſt ſecured with us in England, beyond all apprehenſions whatſoever.—Our prevailing in theſe things would give the greateſt blow to the Proteſtant Religion here, that ever it received from his Birth.—If the Duke ſhould once get above them (after all the Tricks they have plaied with him) they are not ſure he will totally forget the uſage he hath had at their Hands: For my part (ſaith he) I can ſcarce believe my ſelf awake, or the thing real, when I think on a Prince in ſuch an Age, as we live in, to be converted to ſuch a degree of Zeal and Piety, as not to regard any thing in the World in compariſon of Chriſt.\n               Theſe are the Diſcoveries of your Old Servant Mr. Coleman; but to rivet the Matter, I pray, conſider what Diſcoveries you were pleaſed to make of the Union of your Intereſt with that of the French King, which, Sir, will put the Matter out of diſpute. Give me leave to put you in mind of your Letter you wrote to the French King's Confeſſour, wherein you were pleaſed to own that the Intereſts of the French King and yours were ſo clearly linck'd together, that thoſe that oppoſed the one ſhould be looked on as Enemies to the other; and that the French King had told you that he was of the Opinion, that neither the Lord Arlington, nor the Parliament were in his Intereſt, nor yours.\n\n2. As it is as clear as the Day that your Intereſt is not an Engliſh but a French Intereſt; ſo now I muſt tell you in the ſecond place, that your Intereſt being a French Intereſt, it will render your return impoſſible, and the attempt in order to it very fooliſh and irrational. You know that the Engliſh Nation is never ſafe, unleſs a check be put upon the growing Greatneſs of France.\nTherefore do but obſerve the Addreſs of the Houſe of Commons, March 10. 1676, they put the King your Brother in mind of the great Danger that the Nation was expoſed to, by reaſon of the growth of the French King's Power and Greatneſs. Now any Man that is in the Intereſt of the French King, his Intereſt is no ways reconcileable to the Intereſt of England. 1. As to its Peace. 2. As to its Trade. And the Conſequence of both theſe are the Riches of the Nation, which muſt be conſumed by a Prince that is of an Intereſt different from that of the People, 'tis true the preſent War with France hath proved very chargable to the Nation; but here is our Happineſs that we have a King that advanceth the Intereſt of our Trade, his People and He go Hand in Hand, Their Intereſts are the ſame with His, and His the ſame with Theirs; which to me is an Argument, that when it ſhall have pleaſed God, by His Arms, to reduce the French King to Reaſon, that then no Nation under the Heavens can or will be more happy than the Engliſh Nation: But if a Prince ſhall, inſtead of purſuing the Intereſt of his People, purſue their Deſtruction, by ſetting up and advancing the Intereſt of a Foreign Power, his Government cannot ſtand. This, Sir, was that which loſt you your Crown, And can you then expect by that Intereſt to regain the Crown of England, by which you ſtrangely loſt it? Therefore, to conclude this Head, let not your Conſpirators think that it is either probable or poſſible that ever the People of England will ever be brought into a French Intereſt, or ever admit you to reſume the Throne and Government, ſince that you purely loſt it for the ſake of that Intereſt.\nYour Scoundrel Abettors here at Home, are ſuch a ſort of Animals that the Reformed Nations Abroad are at a ſtand, and cannot tell what to make of them, their Carriages of late Years have been ſo unaccountable; and ſince it hath pleaſed God to put it into the Hearts of moſt of the Princes of Europe, though of the Romiſh Communion, heartily to embrace the late Revolution in England, as the laſt Effort for the Common Liberty of Europe, and have entered into the ſtricteſt Alliance with our King (though of a different Religion) to ſupport it; it looks like a Dream to meet with Men that call themſelves Engliſh Proteſtants embarqued in your Intereſt, in oppoſition to the Intereſt of their Native Countrey.\nA little Prieſt of the Church of England, in a Sermon of his on the Day your Father made his Exit, was pleaſed to threaten us with an endleſs War that would be entailed on the Nation; he is a mighty Votary for your Cauſe and Intereſt, notwithſtanding his Oath to King William to the contrary. But, Sir, a thouſand ſuch Fellows can never reconcile your Intereſt with that of England, nor would your Reſtoration put an end to his ſuppoſed War; for it is not reaſonable to imagine that ſo many Noblemen and Gentlemen who have aſſociated, and by their Aſſociation have engaged to ſupport the Intereſt and Cauſe of our\nKing, will tamely ſubmit to your Reſtoration: Or that King William will ever abandon his Throne, or that its poſſible that the Common Cauſe of Europe will ever be ſuffered to ſink in ſuch a manner as to comply with the Pride and Ambition of your Self, or of him whoſe Cauſe you have eſpouſed, and whoſe Intereſt is the very ſame with yours: When you were upon the Throne your Aim was to deſtroy the Intereſt of England, but we have been too many for you, and the Throne is filled up with one that will maintain and ſupport our Intereſt, notwithſtanding the vain Efforts of your Crew both at Home and Abroad to the contrary. And therefore that Loggerhead of a Cathedral Prieſt hath not made one ſingle Convert to your Cauſe and Intereſt, by the Noiſe he made of diſputed Titles and endleſs Wars. I will obſerve this to you that the Raſcal hath more Preferment than Learning or Honeſty, but what can we expect of an Apoſtate?\n               4. We are Freemen, and therefore we can never be ſuppoſed ever to admit you, who have always been a Perſon of Arbitrary Principles, to govern this Nation. You cannot but remember that the Engliſh Nation hath a very great Security for its Liberties; and that is the Government it ſelf, with a good King at the head thereof, and that is our preſent Happineſs; for our King Rules not upon the ſame Terms as your Brother of France doth; for he by Force Uſurps that ſhare which his People ought to have in the Government, and for ſeveral Ages paſt hath been in poſſeſſion of an Arbitrary Power, (which yet no preſcription can make Legal) and he exerciſeth it over the Perſons and Eſtates of his People in a moſt Tyrannical manner: And this your loving and kind Brother and you aimed at, Witneſs your Diſpenſing Power that you took upon you when you aſcended the Throne. But our King hath ſo ordered it, that his Subjects ſhall retain their Proportion in the Legiſlature; the very meaneſt Commoner of England is repreſented in Parliament, and is a Party to thoſe Laws by which our King is Sworn to govern himſelf and his People. 'Tis true you Swore, but you made no Conſcience of your Oath, nor did you in the leaſt boggle at the Violation of our Laws; you hated that way of Government which you had ſolemnly promiſed to maintain and defend, Witneſs the Names you uſed to give the Parliament of England. Now according to the Laws of the Realm no Money is raiſed but by common Conſent: But you were pleaſed to raiſe Money upon the People by your Proclamation. The very Day after you had promiſed to invade no Mans Property: Now no Man is for Life, Limb, Goods, or Liberty, at the Sovereigns Direction; but how ſoon it would have been had not a period been put to your Tyranny? For your Sycophant Paraſites were very zealous to have delivered up thoſe Priviledges in to your Hands, judging it would not be well with England till you were as Abſolute as the Monſter of France, by which we might eaſily underſtand your Intentions. For, Sir, who knows not that the inclination of a Prince is beſt known either by thoſe that are about him, and moſt Favour with him, or by the current of his own Actions? Thoſe who were neareſt to you, and moſt your Favourites, were your Iriſh and French Courtiers, and your Popiſh Prieſts and Prelates, who theſe Men ſtood affected to. Your Diſcretionary Diſpotick Power can never be forgotten: No Man but may remember, that in their common Diſcourſe were for advancing your Will and Pleaſure over\nyour Subjects to be equal with that of the King of France is over his. This was but a Copy which thoſe Villains had induſtriouſly taken from your own Words and Actions. In Scotland you did publickly ſet up for that Power, and openly declared you would be obeyed without reſerve.\n               The attempt you and your Conſpirators made in the time of the Lord Chancellor Hyde upon our Liberties, is never to be forgetten; a Bill was prepared to enable the King your Brother in the time of any interval of Parliament, to raiſe what Money he pleaſed upon an extraordinary occaſion, as the Dutch War was pretended to be. This had taken its much deſired effect, had not that Lord Chancellor been awakened by an intimate Friend of his, who, underſtanding what was doing in the Houſe of Commons, came to him and ſhewed him what the Conſequences were which ſuch an unheard thing would produce; and he uſing one Argument above all the reſt, in telling him he came to his Honour and Greatneſs by the Gown, and not by the Sword; and if that Bill paſſed, he adviſed him to conſider what his Gown, or all the Lawyers Gowns in England were worth, which that Lord Chancellor, though one of the Actors with you to enſlave the Nation, being a Man of Senſe, had that Honor as to think it no Diſhonor to retreat from that Deviliſh Invention, which he to comply with your Ambition and Pride had ſet on foot to deſtroy us at once: So that Bill, though once read in the Houſe for enabling the King, your Brother, to raiſe Money at pleaſure, was by the Providence of God, and the Prudence of that Noble Penitent Lord droped ſo far, as that it dwindled into a Bill of 75000 l. not exceeding a Months Tax. No doubt but you had procured this Bill to be dreſſed in the French Mode for emergent Occaſions; yet had it paſſed in the ſame manner as you and your Accomplices deſigned, there would not have wanted emergent Occaſions, and extraordinary Services to have given Colour for keeping that Power on foot until Dooms Day in the Afternoon.\nThe French King, whoſe Example you followed in this particular, got his Power by ſuch a villainous Stratagem; but he hath not been at leiſure yet to call his Parliament to diſpute that Point. I queſtion not but that your loving Brother and you would have found other Matters of moment, to have diverted you from that way of raiſing Money; ſo England muſt have taken leave of Parliaments for ever, and we muſt have ſubmitted all we had to your French Diſcretion. But through the Bleſſing of Heaven, and the Care of our Legiſlators, we are delivered not only from your Government and your intended French way of Governing; for we continue to have the ſame Right (modeſtly underſtood) in our Propriety that our Prince hath in his Royalty, and in all Caſes where the King himſelf is concerned we have our juſt Remedy, as againſt any private Perſon in the Nation, in the Courts of Weſtminſter-hall, or in the High Court of Parliament; for his Prerogative is not like that you would have uſurped, but what the Law hath only determined. His great Seal, which is the legitimate Stamp of his Royal Will and Pleaſure, yet it is no longer currant than upon the Tryal it is found to be according to Law and Juſtice. The King cannot commit any Man by his own particular Warrant, he cannot be himſelf a Witneſs in any Cauſe whatever, tho your Brother would have been one againſt me. The Ballance of publick Juſtice being ſo delicate, that not the Head only\nbut even the Breath of the King would turn the Scale; nothing is left to the Win of the King, but every thing is ſubject to his legal Authority; by which means it follows, that as he can do no Wrong, nor can he receive Wrong. But you by your Diſpenſing Power put your ſelf in a ſtate of Wronging the Nation, and deſtroying your ſelf and Government; but had you kept to the Meaſures of an Engliſh King, you might have remained to this Day to have been the only intelligent Ruler over a rational People, your Perſon had been Sacred and Inviolable, and whatever Exceſs had been committed in your Reigh, would not have been imputed to you as being free from the Neceſſity and Temptations: Your Miniſters would have been only accountable for all, and muſt have Anſwered it at their Perils. You had a vaſt Revenue, and if any emergency of Affair ſhould have appeared, you had at your Call a number of Men to have adviſed with, a ſupply would have been readily granted. You were the Fountain of Honour, the diſpoſer of many profitable Places both in Church and State; but this would not ſerve your turn, for you would not be abridged the Power of injuring the People of England, but againſt all Law invaded our Rights, and deſigned nothing ſo much as enſlaving us and our Poſterity for ever: And we that have taſted ſo much of the ſweetneſs of Liberty, and on the other hand have ſmarted under your ſhort, but cruel Tyranny will never be intangled again with the French Popiſh Yoke of Bondage, but ſtand in defence of the King we have choſen, and the Liberty we have recovered as long as we have a Being in this World. Therefore conſider with your ſelf the impoſſibility of your return, to that Government you abuſed, to the Adminiſtration of thoſe Laws you violated, to a Nation that you made a Field of Blood; and if you had remained, for ought I know, England might have been a Howling Wilderneſs. In fine, then I am ſure if you ſhould make any attempt to return it will be in vain, and appear very rediculous.\n               5. We have Sworn Allegiance to King William, who is of the ſame Religion and Intereſt with us, who delivered us out of your Hands and the Hands of your villainous Conſpirators, and hath fixed us upon thoſe Foundations, againſt which France, Rome, nor Hell ſhall prevail; he hath ſecured us, our Liberties, Laws and Religion; he hath brought himſelf and Government to that Perfection, notwithſtanding the vexatious War which lies hard upon us, that he is capable of doing good to all Mankind, and he hath totally diſabled himſelf from doing hurt to any; he wants not the French King's Purſe, nor his Friendſhip; he wants not his Intereſt, for his Intereſt is his Peoples, and his Peoples his, by which they are ſo united, that the attempts of your Scoundrel Crew for your Reſtoration will be in vain; the Hearts of the Nation are ſet againſt you, and for your perfidious dealing both in Church and State the People of England will truſt you no more.\nSir, We have Sworn Allegiance to this King we choſe in your ſtead, and we are bound to ſtand by him; our choiſe of him was from a Principle of Love to God and the Proteſtant Religion which he hath aſſerted. You kept not your Faith with us, and therefore our Allegiance ceaſed to you, your Actions have been very plain and open, and ſo pernitious that it was a Wonder of Wonders,\ntha\n•\n we and our Religion have been delivered from Blood and Oppreſſion: And Sir I would let you know that we are not afraid of you and your Adherents, for I believe the Proteſtant Religion and Proteſtant King will ſtand notwithſtanding al\n•\n your Attempts; and if you had brought your French Dragooning Apoſtles o\n•\ner to us, yet we would and ſhould have maintained our Ground, and deſtroyed \n••\nem and you. We value not your little Two-penny Stuff that you have left \n••\nhind you to plead your Cauſe: your impertinent, ignorant Non-juring Clergy-men can never preach us out of love to that Loyalty that we owe to K. William;\n\n•\ne have ſcarce a Williamite Cobler but can baffle them all. Theſe things conſi\n\n•\nered, How can you ever expect any thing leſs than that Judgment the Pſalmiſt \n•\nrays for to be inflicted upon his Enemies? Hath not God already ſet a wicked Tyrant over you? Have you not been Judged by the Lords and Commons of England, and Condemned? Was not your Reign ſhort? And hath not another taken your Office? In time, Sir, the Judgment may be compleated upon you. There is of your Iſſue that have had no Hand in our Miſeries, and for this Cauſe our Eyes are ſet upon them for good, and we ſhall pray for their long Life: But as for you, that God would cloth you with Shame and Confuſion of Face; and that he would upon the Head of our Proteſtant King let the Crown long floriſh: And I do not queſtion but God will hear the Prayers of his Faithful Subjects, and will by his means bring the Nation to ſuch a Settlement that our Allegiance will be firm to him and his Succeſſors, notwithſtanding all thoſe villainous Attempts that you and that Monſter of Mankind your Brother of France, by his and your Traiterous Accomplices, have made to deprive us of ſo great a Bleſſing. Which brings me to a Sixth Conſideration.\n               6. The laſt Reaſon I ſhall give you, why it will be impoſſible for you to return to the Adminiſtration of the Engliſh Government, and that all Attempts of that nature will be in vain, becauſe of your late barbarous and villainous Attempt you by your Conſpirators have made upon the Perſon of our King, and your purpoſe of backing that intended Murder by an unnatural Invaſion; you had ſome that pittied you, but now our Hearts are ſhut up againſt you, and are hardned againſt all your Curſed Adherents: For now your Plot is diſcovered, and it is a Plot and a Villainous One, nothing can be plainer; no Man of Common Underſtanding but muſt ſee your Conſpiracy to bring in Popery and Slavery, and to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion and the Liberties of England. We know, Sir, the Doctrine of your Popiſh and Non-juring Prieſts too well, and your wicked Practices; and we are now aſſured that you will not ſtick at any thing that may bring your wicked Deſigns about. You muſt excuſe me if I am plain with you, I would not aſperſe you with hard Words if they were not very true, I ſhould not have been ſo Hot if you had not been concerned in the late wicked Deſign of murthering our King, but if you had ſucceeded it would have been no more than you did to your Loving and Kind Brother; but all this as well as the other is owing to you and your Popiſh Traiterous Crew, who have debauched Mens Underſtandings, overturned all Morals, and deſtroyed all Divinity. What ſhall I ſay of you and your villainour Party? What is your Charity ſuch as to deſtroy Kings? And where was the Humility of inſulting over the Nation? The Myſtery of Iniquity is revealed, and\nyou are diſappointed: The Nation ſees that you are no Changeling as to y\n••\nr Vices, and you will find that Engliſh-men are no Changelings: Therefore it w\n•\nll be in vain to make any more attempts to be Reſtored again for the future.\n               To conclude this Memorial, Sir, give me leave to tell you that I have thus f\n••\n laid open the Conſpiracy againſt our Religion and Government, and indeed it wa\n•\n more than time it ſhould be diſcovered, for I think here hath been nothing aſſerte\n•\n but what hath been and can be made out; we ſee how the French have been courted by you and your Party; with what Eaſe have they been aſſiſted, and wit\n•\n what Difficulty the Dutch, both in your Brothers and your Reign: We ſee your Brother and you abandon the Prince of Orange, now our King, in compliance with his and the Nations Enemies. How can any Man think upon the French Depredations and Cruelties exerciſed at Sea upon the Subjects of England without Regret? Call to mind your notorious Treacheries in that Affair: Remember the conſtant Irregularities and Injuſtice from term to term of thoſe who ſhould have adminiſtred Juſtice between King and People: Remember the ſearch you made throughout the whole Kingdom to find Men of Arbitrary Principles, that would bow the Knee to Baal in order to their being promoted to all publick Commiſſions and Employments, and diſgracing and diſplacing all thoſe that durſt, in ſo univerſal a Depravation, be honeſt and faithful in their Truſt and Offices. We ſaw to our great Grief the Defection of conſiderable Perſons, both Male and Female, to the Popiſh Religion, as if they enter'd by Couples, Clean and Unclean, into the Ark of that Curſed Synagogue, not more in order to their Salvation than for their Temporal Advantage and Safety. Sir, the State of Ireland managed by your Brother and you would require a Volume to repreſent it; and in your Time we could not but obſerve that all your Affairs and Councils in the Nation tended to a Popiſh Revolution. And by the Foreſight and Civility of the Man of Sin, there was an Engliſh Cardinal prepared, like Cardinal Pool, to give us Abſolution, Benediction, and to receive us to the Obedience of the See of Rome. It is true your Conſpiracy had taken effect had you not met with many Diſappointments; but the laſt Diſappointment was the overturn of all your Deſigns at once, which was occaſioned by the Arrival of the Prince of Orange: Guilt made you to flee. The Senſe the Nation had of your wicked Intentions, againſt our Laws and Liberties, cauſed the People of England to make choice of our Deliverer to reign over us: He is anointed our King, and as God hath ſet a Crown of pure Gold upon his Head, ſo we queſtion not but the ſame God will ſatisfy him with long Life and Happineſs, and that he will give him the Spirit of Wiſdom, Knowledge, Zeal and Faithfulneſs, to do what in him lies to the bringing on the New Heavens and the New Earth wherein Righteouſneſs and Peace ſhall dwell, by repairing the Breaches and decayed Places that you have made and cauſed amongſt us. And from hence, Sir, remember that though Hand join in Hand, yet the Wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed; they are Gods own Words, who hath alſo declared with the greateſt Solemnity, that there ſhall be no Peace to the Wicked, Iſa. 57.21. You have leiſure to conſider of theſe things; and ſo Farewell.\n\nFINIS.\n", "image_url": "A53388/00046.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

Sit punctum V Apsis summa, & scribantur T pro altitudine maxima CV, A pro altitudine quavis alia CP vel Cp, & X pro altitudinum differentia CV−CP; & vis qua corpus in Ellipsi circa umbilicum ejus C (ut in Corollario 2.) revolvente movetur, quae\n\n\n\nque\n in Corollario 2. erat ut Fq./Aq.+RGq.−RFq./A cub. id est ut Fq.A+RGq.−RFq./A cub., substituendo T−X pro A, erit ut RGq.−RFq.+TFq.−Fq.X / A cub. Reducenda similiter est vis alia quaevis centripeta ad fractionem cujus denominator sit A cub., & numeratores, facta homologorum terminorum collatione, statuendi sunt analogi. Res Exemplis patebit.\n                  \nExempl. 1. Ponamus vim centripetam uniformem esse, adeo\n\n\n\nque\n ut A cub./A cub., sive (scribendo T−X pro A in Numeratore) ut T cub.−3Tq.X+3TXq.−X cub./A cub.; & collatis Numeratorum terminis correspondentibus, nimirum datis cum datis & non datis cum non datis, fiet RGq.−RFq.+TFq. ad T cub. ut −Fq.X ad −3Tq.X+3TXq.−X cub. sive ut −Fq. ad −3Tq.+3TX−X q. Jam cum Orbis ponatur circulo quam maxime finitimus, coeat orbis cum circulo; & ob factas R, T aequales, at\n\n\n\nque\n\nX in infinitum diminutam, rationes ultimae erunt RGq. ad T cub. ut −Fq. ad −3Tq. seu Gq. ad Tq. ut Fq. ad 3Tq. & vicissim G quadrat. ad F quadrat. ut T quad. ad 3 T quad. id est, ut 1 ad 3; adeo\n\n\n\nque\n\nG ad F, hoc est angulus VCp ad angulum VCP, ut 1 ad √3. Ergo cum corpus in Ellipsi immobili, ab Apside summa ad Apsidem imam descendendo conficiat angulum VCP (ut ita dicam) graduum 180; corpus aliud in Ellipsi mobili, at\n\n\n\nque\n adeo in orbe immobili de quo agimus, ab Abside summa ad Apsidem imam descendendo conficiet angulum VCp graduum 180/√3: id\nadeo ob similitudinem orbis hujus, quem corpus agente uniformi vi centripeta describit, & orbis illius quem corpus in Ellipsi revolvente gyros peragens describit in plano quiescente. Per superiorem terminorum collationem similes redduntur hi orbes, non universaliter, sed tunc cum ad formam circularem quam maxime appropinquant. Corpus igitur uniformi cum vi centripeta in orbe propemodum circulari revolvens, inter Apsidem summam & Apsidem imam conficiet semper angulum 180/√3 graduum, seu 103 gr. 55 m. ad centrum; perveniens ab Apside summa ad Apsidem imam, ubi semel confecit hunc angulum, & inde ad Apsidem summam rediens, ubi iterum confecit eundem angulum, & sic deinceps in infinitum.\n                  \nExempl. 2. Ponamus vim centripetam esse ut altitudinis A dignitas quaelibet An−3 seu An / A3: ubi n−3 & n significant dignitatum indices quoscun\n\n\n\nque\n integros vel fractos, rationales vel irrationales, affirmativos vel negativos. Numerator ille An\n seu T−X\nn\n in seriem indeterminatam per Methodum nostram Serierum convergentium reducta, evadit Tn−nXTn−1+nn−n/2 Xq.Tn−2 &c. Et collatis hujus terminis cum terminis Numeratoris alterius RGq.−RFq.+TFq.−Fq.X, fit RGq.−RFq.+TFq. ad Tn\n ut −Fq. ad −nTn−1+nn−n/2 XTn−2 &c. Et sumendo rationes ultimas ubi orbes ad formam circularem accedunt, fit RGq. ad Tn\n ut −Fq. ad −nTn−1, seu Gq. ad Tn−1 ut Fq. ad nTn−1, & vicissim Gq. ad Fq. ut Tn\n−1 ad nTn−1 id est ut 1 ad n; adeo\n\n\n\nque\n\nG ad F, id est angulus VCp ad angulum VCP, ut 1 ad √n. Quare cum angulus VCP, in descensu corporis\nab Apside summa ad Apsidem imam in Ellipsi confectus, sit graduum 180, conficietur angulus VCp, in descensu corporis ab Apside summa ad Apsidem imam in Orbe propemodum circulari, quem corpus quodvis vi centripeta dignitati An−3 proportionali describit, aequalis angulo graduum 180/√n; & hoc angulo repetito corpus redibit ab Apside ima ad apsid\n•\nm summam, & sic deinceps in infinitum. Ut si vis centripeta sit ut distantia corporis a centro, id est ut A seu A4/A3, erit n aequalis 4 & √4 aequalis 2; adeo\n\n\n\nque\n angulus inter Apsidem summam & Apsidem imam aequalis 180/2 gr. seu 90 gr. Completa igitur quarta parte revolutionis unius corpus perveniet ad Apsidem imam, & completa alia quarta parte ad Apsidem summam, & sic deinceps per vices in infinitum. Id quod etiam ex Propositione X. manifestum est. Nam corpus urgente hac vi centripeta revolvetur in Ellipsi immobili, cujus centrum est in centro virium. Quod si vis centripeta sit reciproce ut distantia, id est directe ut 1/A seu A2/A3, erit n=2, adeo\n\n\n\nque\n inter Apsidem summam & imam angulus erit graduum 180/√2 seu 127 gr. 17 min. & propterea corpus tali vi revolvens, perpetua anguli hujus repetitione, vicibus alternis ab Apside summa ad imam & ab ima ad summam perveniet in aeternum. Porro si vis centripeta sit reciproce ut Latus quadrato-quadratum undecimae dignitatis Altitudinis, id est reciproce ut A11/4, adeo\n\n\n\nque\n directe ut 1/A 11/4 seu ut A ¼ / A3\n erit n aequalis ¼, & 180/√n gr. aequalis 360 gr. & propterea corpus de Apside summa discedens & subinde perpetuo descendens, perveniet ad Apsidem imam ubi complevit revolutionem integram; dein perpetuo ascensu complendo aliam revolutionem integram, redibit ad Apsidem summam: & sic per vices in aeternum.\n                  \nExempl. 3. Assumentes m & n pro quibusvis indicibus dignitatum Altitudinis, & b, c pro numeris quibusvis datis, ponamus vim centripetam effe ut b Am+c An / A cub., id est ut b in T−Xm+c in T−Xn / A cub. seu (per eandem Methodum nostram Serierum convergentium) ut bTm−mbXTm\n−1+mm−m/2bX2Tm\n−2+cTn−ncXTn\n−1+nn−n/2 cX2\nTn\n−2\n&c./A Cub. & collatis numeratorum terminis, fiet RGq.−RFq.+TFq. ad bTm+cTn, ut −Fq. ad −mbTm−1−ncTn−1+mm−m/2−XTm−2+nn−n/2 XTn−2 &c. Et sumendo rationes ultimas quae prodeunt ubi orbes ad formam circularem accedunt, fit Gq. ad bTm−1+cTn−1, ut Fq. ad mbTm−1+ncTn−1, & vicissim Gq. ad Fq. ut bTm−1+cTn−1 ad mbTm−1+ncTn−1. Quae proportio, exponendo altitudinem maximam CV seu T Arithmetice per unitatem, fit Gq. ad Fq. ut b+c ad mb+nc, adeo\n\n\n\nque\n ut 1 ad mb+nc / b+c. Unde est G ad F, id est angulus VCp ad angulum VCP, ut 1 ad √mb+nc / b+c. Et propterea cum angulus VCP inter Apsidem summam & Apsidem imam in Ellipsi immobili sit 180 gr. erit angulus VCp inter easdem Apsides, in Orbe quem corpus vi centripeta quantitati bAm+cAn / A cub. proportionali describit, aequalis angulo graduum 180 √b+c / mb+nc. Et eodem argumento si vis centripeta sit ut bAm−cAn / A cub., angulus inter Apsides invenietur 180 √b−c / mb−nc graduum. Nec secus resolvetur Problema in casibus\ndifficilioribus. Quantitas cui vis centripeta proportionalis est, resolvi semper debet in series convergentes denominatorem habentes A cub. Dein pars data Numeratoris hujus RGq.−RFq.+TFq.−Fq.X ad partem non datam in eadem ratione ponendae sunt: Et quantitates superfluas delendo, scribendo\n\n\n\nque\n unitatem pro T, obtinebitur proportio G ad F.\n\nCorol. 1. Hinc si vis centripeta sit ut aliqua altitudinis dignitas, inveniri potest dignitas illa ex motu Apsidum; & contra-Nimirum si motus totus angularis, quo corpus redit ad Apsidem eandem, sit ad motum angularem revolutionis unius, seu graduum 360, ut numerus aliquis m ad numerum alium n, & altitudo nominetur A: erit vis ut altitudinis dignitas illa A nn / mm−3, cujus Index est nn / mm−3. Id quod per Exempla secunda manifestum est. Unde liquet vim illam in majore quam triplicata altitudinis ratione decrescere non posse: Corpus tali vi revolvens de\n\n\n\nque\n Apside discedens, si caeperit descendere, nunquam perveniet ad Apsidem imam seu altitudinem minimam, sed descendet us\n\n\n\nque\n ad centrum, describens curvam illam lineam de qua egimus in Corol. 3. Prop. XLI. Sin caeperit illud de Apside discedens vel minimum ascendere, ascendet in infinitum, ne\n\n\n\nque\n unquam perveniet ad Apsidem summam. Describet enim curvam illam lineam de qua actum est in eodem Corol. & in Corol. 6. Prop. XLIV. Sic & ubi vis in recessu a centro decrescit in majori quam triplicata ratione altitudinis, corpus de Apside discedens, perinde ut caeperit descendere vel ascendere, vel descendet ad centrum us\n\n\n\nque\n vel ascendet in infinitum.

And it will be the glorious Work of great Princes, to cauſe the Publick Conſtitutions about Religion in their Dominions, to be large and good; and ſuch, as a great Part of the Holieſt and beſt Chriſtians may not be Excluded and Trampled upon, but taken in and Encouraged.\n            But becauſe all lies not on thoſe that have Power to impoſe, but much alſo upon Private Chriſtians;\nSixthly, Hence alſo it follows plainly, That Perſons and Churches that are better than others, are to own others if Built on the true Foundation, for true Chriſtians and Churches; and thoſe that are worſe than others are to own thoſe for true Chriſtians and Churches that are better than they, and to love them as ſuch. Some perhaps will ſay, yes, if they be in different Kingdoms, but not if they be in the ſame. But why not, though in the ſame Kingdom? Who made the diſtinction?\nSeventhly, That Perſons and Churches Built upon the large and true Foundation of Faith and Love, are to ſtrive to hold Communion one with another; The ſtronger and better, with thoſe that are weaker, and the weaker with thoſe that are better. It's a great Errour to think we may ſeparate for every cauſe, as the Jews did in their Divorces; and that there's no true way of Reforming but by Separateing: Therefore they do ill, that will not Communicate with Churches where they lawfully may, at leaſt ſometimes; and they do yet worſe, that will hold no Communion with the beſt Churches, where the beſt Doctrine, Worſhip, and Spiritual helps for Souls are.\nEighthly, That Perſons, and Churches that own others for true Churches, may be oblig'd not to hold Communion with them in the Publick Worſhip of God, at leaſt not conſtantly. Not at all, becauſe ſuch Churches may practice things that are unlawful, and make them the Conditions of their Communion; or Perſons may think ſuch things unlawful which are not; and while their Errour continues, they cannot joyn with them, without going againſt their Conſcience.\n\nNot conſtantly, becauſe ſuch Churches may uſe many needleſs, inconvenient, and ſuſpicious things, tho' they that diſſent will not ſay they are abſolutely unlawful; or may ſtick in their weaker beginnings, or go backward, and deny them the uſe of thoſe Spiritual means which Chriſt hath given for the promoting their Salvation.\nNinthly, That there may be true Chriſtian Love between thoſe who do not hold Publick Communion with one another; becauſe they may both be built on the true Foundation of Faith, and Love. And it's a fond imagination, (to which yet many are too ſubject) to think, that thoſe that will not joyn with them, cannot love them; or that we muſt needs want love to thoſe we cannot joyn with. To think ſo, is a great miſtake,See Dr. Owen of Evangelical Love. diſown'd by all Sober Perſons, and a curſed Root of bitterneſs, and I fear defiles many. 'Tis a ſad thing to ſee this in ſo many, and is a ſign that moſt build their Religion more upon leſſer things, wherein the Life of it lies not, than on thoſe main things wherein it lies.\nIf any ſay, this will caſt out Diſcipline, and many choice Truths of Chriſt, and introduce Erroneous Rotten Doctrines. I ſay it will not; for tho' People that are weak and diſorder'd, may be true Chriſtians, and Churches, it hinders not but that others may and ought to ſeek after Diſcipline, and Truth, and grow in the ways of God. And they do ill, whoever they are, that ſhall hinder this.

A Soveraign prince is the Father of his Country▪ and can reaſonably have no diſtinct intereſt from the Publick for his Kingdom is his Inheritance, and his Glory and power conſiſt\n•\n in the happy and flouriſhing State of his people. When his Kingdom is well govern'd, his Subjects pleaſed and eaſie, this makes him beloved at home, and feared abroad.

There is more apparent danger of Oppreſſion, when there are ſo many to raiſe their Fortunes by the Government, who have private Intereſts and Deſignes, and muſt be paid well for their publick Service. Whereas no Prince ought to think himſelf poor, while his Subjects are rich; and nothing can reaſonably tempt an Hereditary Monarch to drain his Subjects to fill his own Exchequer, but their Factious or Sparing Humour; then indeed it concerns a Prince to get and to keep Money by him, when he finds ſo much occaſion for it, and ſees it ſo hard to come by. But this is the fault of the Subject, not of the Prince: for were Subjects dutiful and obedient, quiet and peaceable, and ready at all times to grant Supplies, as the ſupport of the Government needed, without difficulty or diſhonourable terms; He muſt be a ſtrange Prince who would oppreſs his Subjects, when he knows he may have what he can reaſonably deſire, without oppreſſion; when his Subjects pockets are as open and a more increaſing Exchequer than his own:\n", "image_url": "A59875/00005.000.001.left.png", "label": "0"}

Nobility of Birth gives a Luſter and Authority to ſuch a Prince's Government. Men do not love to ſubmit to their Equals or Inferiors; when ſuch aſcend the Throne, they are deſpiſed and envied, and nothing but Force and Power can keep them there. But a High born Prince is the pride and the deſire of a Nation: he inherits the Glory of his Anceſtors; and the World preſages great things of him, who deſcends from a race of Kings; no man thinks much to ſubmit to him, who was born to govern, but thoſe, who are impatient of any Government, or ambitious of Government themſelves.

And this ſhows us the advantages of an Hereditary Monarchy. For the Royal Family is certainly the moſt Noble: a King, who is the Son of Kings, to be ſure is the Son of Nobles. And it is the higheſt and greateſt Nobility of which Solomon ſpeaks; to be ſure, what he ſays muſt be eminently true of the moſt Noble Blood. A King's Son, eſpecially if he deſcend from an Ancient race of Kings, has as much the advantage of Inferiour Nobles, as they have of the Gentry, or the Gentry of meaner People. It is Royal Blood, which inſpires a Princely Mind, which is more Noble ſtill the further it is removed from its Original.\nI cannot now diſcourſe to you concerning the Right of Succesſion; it ſeems moſt Natural for a Son to be Heir to his Father, and therefore to ſucceed to the Crown of which he dyed poſſeſſed for Power deſcends as well as an Eſtate, as the Government of the Family was the Birthright of the Eldeſt Son, as his Fathers Heir.

For besides the Satisfaction\nto the Drinkers of them, which ariseth from the\nKnowledge of their Principles, the Effects of the\nChalybeat and Purging Waters of England are\nso great, and the Cures perform'd by them in\nObstinate and the less understood Distempers\nare so very extraordinary, that (were their Natures\nbetter understood) we must expect no inconsiderable\nAdvantage from the proper Use of\nso Noble a REmedy: Since this would direct us\nnot only to the more certain Use of them, but\nadvance our Understanding to the Discovery of\nother Distempers, in which they might succeed\nand help us to avoid all that ill Success that attends\ntheir improper Administration. How necessary\nsuch Exactness is to the understanding\ntheir Natures, will appear sufficiently if we consider\nwhat vastly different Qualities are found to\nbe in the Waters reputed of the same Species,\nwhich yet may be owing only to the Variety of\nthe Salts with which they may be impregnate;\nof which Variety I shall give some particular\nInstances, because it is of great Consequence,\nand hath hitherto been unheeded. The Vertues\nof the Chalybeat Waters have been as yet so\nmuch attributed to the Metalline parts or Steel,\nthat (setting aside the Vehicle of Water, the\nBenefit of which is taken notice of by some) in\nthe Choice of these nothing usually is consulted\nbut the Quantity of Steele evidenc'd in the depth\nof its Tinging with Galls, and yet in this so uniform\na Species, it is easie to discern that Variety\nof Nature and Effects, that will oblige him who\nobserves it, to allow so much to the Menstruum\nof it, or the Salt that is added (either in its Quantity\nor Quality) as is sufficient to constitute Medicines\nof a quite different Nature. Hypochondriacal\nCases (in which the Intention seems most\nGeneral) the Light sort claim as their Province\nto relieve; and I never knew the Heavy ones\nused in, but with the ill success of aggravating\nthe Distemper with an uneasie Heat, and with\nvery little of the good Effects that attend the\nlight ones. The Propriety of these Waters in\nsome other Distempers, as Obstructions of several\nParts, upon the account of their lightness\nand thinness, and particular sort of Spirit, appears\nlikewise in the Chapter of their Vertues.\nThe heavy Waters that have more of the Mineral\nof Iron, but clogg'd with Salt, have different\nreferences according to the differing Nature\nof the Salt, and quantity of Mineral they\nbear, whereof the Nitrous (for such some prove\nto be) regard properly that heavy and black\nCrasis of the Blood of the Melancholick; for I\ndistinguish the Melancholy, properly so call'd,\nwhich hath its Root in the Constitution, from\nthe affectio Hypochondriaca: The other, which\nhave a Salt of the same Vitriolick Nature with\nthe Spirit, are a peculiar in those cases which I\ncall Climacteric of elder Persons and some others,\nwhich require the enriching of the Blood, and\nthe help of a Salt more effectual, gross, and\nlasting, than is the light Spirit. And as some\ncases may require the same Vitriolick Salt to\nhelp the Appetite and restrain Flatulencies, where\nthe Blood as it needs not, so bears not much of the\nbody of the Steele, [For such is the case in some\nPersons past Fifty, of a florid Complexion, and\nwho breed Blood fast] so a Water that is thus\nqualified, of which I have given an instance,\nmay be reputed another Species, and for its\nreal use deserves well to be distinguish'd. The\nSalts which these weighty Waters extract from\nthe Soil, it is likely may vary very much, yet\nhaving not found any of them to contain Saltpetre,\nand the difference of their Virtues depending\nchiefly on their being more or less Alkalisat,\nI \n•\nay not so muc\n•\n\n\n••\night on those lesser\nQualities, as to distingu\n••\n\n\n〈◊〉\n Waters by them,\nthough I take notice of the\n•\n\n\n〈◊〉\n the Essays of the\nWaters: But there are other Qualities that Waters\nmay derive from the places where they run,\nwhich are less sensible, and may lye in some\nMotion or Texture (rather than in any Accession\nof Particles) that a particular Distemper or Constition,\nbesides what a tender one might, may\nreceive an Impression from; these are Coldness\nand Hardness: And these are so considerable,\nas to be allow'd by some Physicians rationally\nenough, to have been the Cause of an Epilepsie,\nthat seiz'd a Gentlewoman, whom I knew,\nupon drinking for a Chlorosis a Water that\nissues from a Stone Quarry. Again, as the Waters\nhave d\n•••\nerent Effects from their different\nQualifications, so they have some Effects in common\nfrom their common, or general, or more\nEssential ones. That which I shall take notice\nof here, is the Prevention of the Generation of\nthe Stone; because their Pretention that makes\nthem here Competitors, is a Propriety of this\nKind of Mineral Waters, which is explain'd in\nthis History, and confirms it, and was never\nbefore discover'd or understood. The Purging\nWaters owing their Virtues wholly to their\nSalts, are much more various in their Nature,\nand the Ignorance of the different Nature of\nthese Salts, has made their different Effects unquestion'd,\nand so hitherto to escape Observation;\nand though the Subtilty and Fluxilness of\nsome of these Salts, and not of others, may seem\nto most Men too slight to deserve Consideration,\nand has neither been observ'd nor inquir'd into;\nyet it is most certain, that those very Qualities\ngive the Waters a different Capacity. Epsom\nand Acton (which both bear only this kind of\nSalt, that neither admits of Christallizing, nor\nabides the Warmth of a Temperate Hand) on\nthis Account, as they are more Effectual in\nGrosser Bodies, so in Leaner in the very same\nCases prevail not, nor agree: And on the same\nScore, I have found them Effectual in some old\nCholicks and Cramps, where the Passages and\nVessels that wanted cleansing were very small,\nor the Matter glutinous or viscous. The same\nQualifications which these Waters have for deterging,\nand are conspicuous in the Galling of\nthe Arcus and Urinary Passage, that attends often\nthe Operation of these Waters, above what is\nusually observ'd in drinking the others, may reasonably\nenough have an advantageous Use likewise\nin Ulcers of the Kidneys in a cautious and\njudicious Hand; and they often have been by\nme observed to be successful in some Obstructions\nof them; which together with the Inconvenience\nof an Ischuria, that sometimes attends\ntheir improper or unseasonable Use, makes this\nConsideration to merit our Attention, and besides,\nthe Softness of the Salt I am speaking of, may\ngive rise to a Thought, that some emollient or\nrelaxing Quality may be communicated in some\ncases, as in Melancholy for example, above what\nother Waters can be expected to exert. But besides\nthe Qualities now consider'd, this History\nwill inform us of Differences of the Salts of these\nPurging Waters in more essential Qualities▪ and\nthat these are almost as many as the Waters;\nwhereof some few stand at such a distance, as\nAlkalys and Sea-salt; and their Virtues are so\nproportionably distant, that till I consider'd, that\nthe Knowledge of the first, assisted me in the\nObservation of the latter, I was apt to wonder\nhow so frequent Instances should slip the regard\nof even the most considerable Men, it is familiar\nfor Scorbutick Indispositions, to be relievd by\none Water and aggravated by another. I have\nknown Instances of a Scorbutick Scabies, and a\nLeprous Disease, each increas'd by drinking the\nWater of Brentwood-weal, which abated upon\nthe use of Woodham Ferrys. And this is the clearer\nand fairer Example, because both these Diseases\nhave been effectually cured by Lambeth Water.\nAnd I may observe, that this makes much for the\nValidity of this Account, that the discoverable\nQualities of the Salts of these Waters, so justly\ncorrespond with their experimented Virtues; for\nwhich reason in treating of those Waters now\nnam'd, I have oppos'd or compar'd the Qualities\nof them to each other. Indeed, though the clear\nand convincing Detection of their Differences, and\nof the Salts they bear relation to, be only subject\nto nice Essays; yet they confess to the bare Taste\nwide differences, some being Bitter, more Saline\nsome, some Sweet, some Insipid, or near the Taste\nof common Water, some have a Vitriolick Sweetness,\nsome are Austere, &c. which hitherto has\nescap'd Observation: So that Mineral Waters\nseem one of the greatest as well as the most useful\nBranches of the Materia Medica. In sum, It is\nby the understanding their Origine and Nature,\nthat we can ascertain Rules and distinguish Errors\nin taking them, readily discover their proper Uses,\nand by directing to other Cases and Distempers\nin which they may be applicable on the same\nReason and Account, may improve and advance\ntheir Virtues: And besides, the least piece of Service\nthis does in the recording their Uses, and\ngiving those Signs, that may direct the Discovery\nof other Wells, with the advantage of an Example\nto direct the proving them, is not inconsiderable.\nThe Benefit of all this, that I may not seem to\nabound in my own Sense, I shall give in the words\nof the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\nSociety. All which being consider'd,Numb. 51.\nwe cannot but add, That\nwhoever discovers such Healing\nWaters, and publickly prescribes the safe and\nright Use of them, does really distribute larger\nand nobler Alms, than if he built and endow'd a\nSavoy; for this prolongs Life, and restores\nHealth (which is sometimes better than Life)\nboth to Rich and Poor, to Natives and Strangers,\nto Neighbours and Travellers.\nAccording to this Design, the History of these\nWaters will come under these three Heads; The\nGeneral History of them; The Essays of the\nseveral Waters, and then their Uses. I shall\ntreat of these two Kinds of Waters distinctly,\nand observe that order, that Repetition may be\navoided, and the former parts of the Discourse\nmay enlighten the latter.\n\n                  Of the Nature of Common Water.\n                  THere are many Questions, which seem to\nlye in my way to be discuss'd, as of the\nOrigine of Springs, Nature and Origine of Mineral\nJuyces and Vitriols; Of the Causes of the Heat\nof the Earth, &c. which the following History\nmakes to disappear. I shall therefore avoid the\nProlixity caused by such Disputes, and only make\nsome Remarks on the Affections and Nature of\nSimple or Common Water, which may help us to\nthe better conceiving of the Nature of Mineral\nones.\n1. Waters receive their Salts of the Earths\nthey wash.\n2. Common Water holds no Metalline parts,\nnor will receive any; Mineral Acids being necessary\nfor Vitriols: And though gravelly Waters,\njust at their Eruption, will take so much of\nan Iron as with Galls will make Ink, yet that the\nAcidity belch'd up at those places is a distinct\nthing, and not of the same Original, is evident,\nin that the Water looses that Quality a few Yards\nfrom the Spring, and then ceases to take any discoverable\nParts or Qualities from either Iron,\nor Copper, or Brass.\n3. All Waters flow on a Loam, or fat heavy\nEarth, such as Tiles are made of, and there is a\ndead heavy sort of it, known by its Blackness,\nWeight and Stonyness, which is the common\nFloor of Springs, and is therefore call'd in Norfolk\nthe Pan of the Earth, beyond which no Pumpmaker\nexpects to find Water, or attempts to dig\nfor it: All the Earth above this approaches to a\nNitre, being so much the more Nitrous, by how\nmuch more it is wrought on by the Sun and Air:\nNitre being receiv'd as a Name for any Native\nSalt of the Superficial Earth, by the Sun and Air\nproduced or separated, which is void of Metalline\nParts and Nature, and in differing Climates is advanc'd\ntoward an Alkalisat or Urinous Salt, in\nproportion to the Heat of the Country, and Situation\nof the Soil. And I never found any Metalline\nBodies or Juyces yet, but what were embrac'd\nin Stone or Loam, and not in Clays.\n                  4. Hence Waters that wash this upper Soil, or\nRivers and Springs that lye in Clays, are Saline;\nGravelly Waters yield little besides some stony\nparts, unless they have wash'd off some Salt from\nNeighbouring Soils; which discovers its Original\nin the Essays.\n5. Not to take notice of the Qualities of Humecting\nor Moistning, &c. the most considerable\nAffection of Water is, that it is void of Elasticity\nand igneous Particles, and unapt to Fermentation.\nYet these Observations of mine, I offer not\notherwise, than to submit them for better Judgment\nand Experience to inquire into.\nThe Waters under Examination are the Saline,\nnamely, The Purging ones, and the Acidulae\nor Chalybeat ones: Of these first.\n\n\n\n               PART I.\n               Of the Chalybeat Waters of England.\n               THE Chalybeat Waters are preferable\nnot only for Antiquity of Discovery,\nbut also for Virtue, being an effectual\nRefuge for many deplorable Diseases that no\nother Remedy prevails in: They are quick\nSprings, ever flowing in a Sand or Gravel. I\nshall first state their Characteristicks, or Signs\nby which they are distinguish'd from other Waters;\nand then explain those Circumstantial\nSigns, and their Reasons, in an account of their\nNature.\nTheir Characteristicks are,\n1. To shew the Mineral they bear (which is\nSteele) in their Taste, and with Galls, to evidence\nit in the blew or purplish black Colour\nproper to Vitriols of Iron, as also by dropping a\nFerrugineous Ocre at the Spring.\n2. The second is, The Lightness of the Spirit\nthat holds the Tincture, which vanishes upon\nexposing to the Air, and leaves the Water without\nthe Mineral Tincture. The lightness of this\nSpirit so affects those Waters of this kind that\nare more void of Salt, as to render them lighter\nthan Rain-water distill'd.\n\n3. The Spring ever proceeds from a Rock\nusually consisting of gravelly Stones cemented\ntogether.\n               4. If it joyn any other common Water immediately\nnear the Fountain, it thence incrusts the\nStones and Sticks, which it washe\n•\n, with a Mortar-like\ncrust The notice of this Incrustation\nhas made many Learned Men, and\nparticularly Dom\n•\n Panarolus,\nPart 2. Obj. 16. erroneously\nto entertain an ill Opinion of the\nWater, because (as he observed in\nthat four Miles from Rome, extra Portam hostiensem\nvulgo S. Pauli) of the stony Matter the\nWater leaves where it passes, and this through\nthe Mistake that this Matter is in the Water\nat the Spring.\n5. To bear an Oyly or Bituminous Film on it\nlike a Scum.\n6. To give a Green upon the Mixture of Syrup\nof Violets.\nThese Waters differ on account of the Salt of\nthe Water, in the Quantity or Quality of it, or\nproportion of the Steel they bear; and so may\nnot have the second Qualification which is proper\nto the simple ones. For the Nature and\nReason of these Waters, we must examine these\nparticulars, not only since most of them are the\nIndexes, but also are effected by the Essential\nProperties of these Waters; and shew the Metalline\nparts, and the Nature of the Menstruum\nor Spirit. The Metal is evident from the blew\nblack they take with Galls, from the Taste,\nand lastly the Okar which it casts out at the\nopening of the Spring, which calcin'd with Salt,\nand expos'd to the Air, shews none of the Verdigreese\nColour that Hungarian Vitriol gives\nupon the same Trial. The Menstruum, or\nSpirit, is a distinct thing from the Salt of them,\nand of a differing Original, being contrary in\nNature, not held by it, and being found in those\nWaters that want the Salt, for the Salt of those\nthat have any, is wash'd from the Earth by the\nWater, and the Spirit is only a Steam that comes\nalong with the Gravel. The Spirit, or Menstruum,\nthat bears this Tincture, is Volatile,\nand continues not with the Water many hours,\n(scarce well one in the light sort) though well\ncork'd up. What effect Hermetick Seal might\nhave, I never had encouragement to attempt, as\nnever believing that a fair Trial, where the\npower of the Fire came so near and so naked,\nand the Chalybeat Waters that abound with\nSalt are often Nitrous, and so may mortifie the\nSpirituous Acid, which may make it in vain\nlook'd for in the Receiver: This I mention for\ncaution sake; for that this Spirit is Volatile, yet\nthat it can be detain'd by a cover of Oyl for\nten days, I lately try'd with a Light Chalybeat\nat Felstead. The Original of this Vapour is\npointed out to be low, and to proceed with all\nGravel; as is evident in free Springs, that upon\nlaying Iron at the Eruption of them, will Tinge\nwith Galls, which power the Water loses at a\nRods distance; but in these it is less in Quantity.\n               \nThe Nature of this Spirit is Vitriolick: They\ndisturb not a Solution of Sublimate in fair Water,\nand with Lignum Nephriticum thicken a\nlittle with a Cloud, but do not the least change\nyellowish as Pump-water and Nitrous, but\nnear that of a Solution of Vitriol, or its Spirit\nupon the same, though scarce so clear, because\nall these Waters have a touch of the Salt of the\nSoyl, as appears in the green with Syrup of\nViolets. They all likewise render a Solution of\nSal Saturni in fair Water milky, by which the\nSpirit is distinguish'd from Saltpetre or its Spirit.\nNote, That though these Tryals are fairly\nmade, only in the lighter simpler Waters, in order\nto make a Judgment of them, yet they hold\nin the heavier Waters, except that Tryal with\nLignum Nephriticum, in which they discover\ntheir Salt, by the yellow colour they give.\nNow the Nature of Salt of Vitriol appears upon\nexamination, to differ very little from common\nSalt (if any thing) more than in the Qualities\nimpress'd in it by the Metal; and it is worth\nour notice, that Vitriols and Nitres precipitate\neach other, being the Product of two several\nRegions; which will enlighten to the Understanding\nthe next Particulars observ'd to attend\nthese Waters.\n               The Earth and Soyl of these Springs, is ever\na Sand or Gravel, and the Water issues from,\nor rather makes, a Rock of cemented Stones,\nwhich are never to be found, but where the\nWater is Vitriolick. This sort of Rock is open\nto view at Tunbridge, and has never yet fail'd,\nwhere the Ground in which these Springs are\nfound has been open'd, as at Notly, Felstead,\nand other lesser Springs. I am apt to think that\nIron may have a particular Qualification for the\ncementing of Earth and Stone, but that I may\nfollow my subject more closely, I shall only consider\nit as the next Particular illustrates it.\n               These Waters, when they joyn another Water,\nat least a gravelly one, e'er they have ran\nso far as to lose their Spirit, precipitate a Mortar-like\nsubstance, wherewith they incrust the\nStones and Sticks they pass over. That this\nstony Matter is precipitated out of other Waters\nwhich flow into it by the Virtue of this\nWater, and proceeds not from the Chalybear\nWater it self, beside the Argument that may be\ndrawn from the Lightness in weight of the Chalybeat,\nappears fully demonstrated at many\nSprings, indeed▪ at all, where the rill of common\nWater runs along the side of the Soyl\nwhence the Chalybeat issues, especially when it\nis in a Meadow (as it was at Felstead where I\nfirst observ'd it) no Incrustation or Precipitation\nof stony Matter being to be found either in the\nMeadow where the Chalybeat lyes, or above\nbefore the other Water joyns it. The Water\nI now nam'd, is one of the light sort, being near\nten Grains in seven Ounces lighter than common\nWater, and the Water that joyns it a hard\ngravelly one, which with Tincture of Logwood\ngave a Rasberry red as Acids, which is not\namiss to mention. The Reason which I intimated\nabove, to be from the differing Natures\nof Nitres and Vitriols, may help make this intelligible.\nThe Lightness in weight of the Chalybeat\nWaters, that as they are void of Salt,\nmay properly enough be said to be more simple,\nis owing to the same Cause, and proves the\nsame thing, being not from difference of the\nSeason, as is usually judg'd, which can never\nmake it lighter than even that Rain-water distill'd,\nthat must render it so; but from the\nDepuration it has receiv'd by the Precipitation\nof the Earthy parts: And the Property is the\nsame by which these Waters even in Human or\nAnimal Bodies Cure the Stone, by removing the\nDisposition to it, as well as early Precipitation\nof the Matter; and this Virtue in the Waters is\nso constant, as to have made them Famous in\nthis particular. The last considerable Sign and\nAttendant of these Waters, is the Bituminous\nScum appearing on them, how far the fatness\nof the Earth of these Waters is assisting in\nseparating this Spirit, or whether it is the Effect\nof it, is not plain, nor very material to learn:\nThat it is of the Nature of common Salt, to\nassist in the Separation of Oyly parts, is evident\nin pickling Roses, and distilling Oyls, but whether\nit be from this, or the Putridness of the\nSoyl and Earth, I shall submit, and leave.\n               These Waters differ not only in Degrees\nof Hardness and Coldness, which is best\ntaken notice of in the Examination of each\nWater, but may be distinguish'd into these two\nHeads.\n               1. The Light ones, which have more of the\nSpirituous Parts of the Vitrioline Spirit, and\nmore Simply.\n2. The Heavy ones, that contain a Salt approaching\nto a Nitre, or is Nitrous.\nOf the Heavy ones first, and then I ascend to\nthe Lighter, which thereby may be illustrated.\n\n                  The First Class.\n                  Chalybeat Waters that contain a Nitrous\nSalt, and equal at least common Water\nin weight.\n                  THE Salt of these Waters I conclude to be\nowing to the Soyle, because it is found to\nbe of the same Nature, and has some Differences,\nbut those being small, I omit, and forbear insisting\nupon them.\nIn the general Design of the use of Chalybeats,\nthese Nitrous Waters are not so Effectual, and\nthe more Nitrous the worse, by which I mean,\nthe more Alkalisat; which is easily prov'd, by the\nearly Precipitation of the Black, and the change\ntowards a Green, which is the Effect of Alkalys\nwith Ink, though at first they change the Blew\nBlack into a Purple. The Characteristick Notes\nof these Waters, beside the weight, are, to drop\nthe Inky colour they receive with Gall, to take\na high colour with Lignum Nephriticum, and\nwhen the Water has stood to be effete, it will\nnot precipitate Silver out of Spirit of Nitre. I\nhave not found any of this kind so fully Nitrous\nor Alkalisat, as to trouble a Solution of Sublimate,\nmuch less to precipitate it Yellow, (both\nwhich indeed are inconsistent with Vitriols) nor\nany that bear a Salt of the Nature of Saltpetre.\n               \n\n                  A Water in a Field adjoyning to the Right\nHonourable the Earl of Manchester's\nPlace, at Leez in Essex.\n                  THis Spring is in a Gravel, and is so small\nas to be considerable, only in that it is in a\nbreeding Pond. This Water disturbs not a Solution\nof Sublimate in fair Water, it render'd\nmilky a Solution of Sal Saturni, by which it distinguish'd\nit self from Saltpetre, but yet not\nmuch more than Saltpetres second Salt does.\nWith Lignum Nephriticum it gave a pale Yellow\nand not fine, exactly the colour of small Beer,\nwhich at four days end precipitated so as to\nleave just the top of the Liquor clear. The\nWater kept till it had lost its Spirit, and with\nthat its power of striking black with Gall (which\nwas 24 hours) essay'd with Gall, was thick\nand dirty white, which precipitated in the\nformer Experiment, shewing an Affinity with\ncommon Salt, in this with Nitrous. It is much\nof the weight of common Water, and takes a\nblew black with Galls.\n               \n\n                  The Water at Witham in Essex, in\nSir Edward Southcot's Ground.\n                  WITH Gall a deep Purple turning to Ink,\nnot very clear; and with Lignum Nephriticum\na faint dull reddish. I judged this to\nhave more of the nature of the Salt of common\nWater, and that the Spirit of this Water to be\na little finer than the other sort, which give a direct\nBlack with Gall, because distill'd Acids\ngive this Red. The Red that Alkalys give turns\ngreenish upon standing, these Waters are all inclin'd\nto the same.\n\n\n                  The Chalybeat Water of Knarsborough in\nYorkshire.\n                  \nKNarsborough Water, as Dr. French relates,\nis of a Vitrioline Taste and Odour; The\nWater riseth in a moorish boggy Ground (within\nless than half a Mile from which, there is no\nconsiderable Ascent) and springeth directly up\nfrom the Sandy bottom. It is of the same\nweight with common Spring Water: The colour\nwith Syrup of Violets is much the same as\nin the Chalybeat Waters at Islington and Hamstead;\nnot so intense as in Tunbridge or the German\nSpa, as the Learned Dr. Tancred Robinson,\nmy Informer, prov'd it at the Spring. And as\nthis colour is not so deep as that made by\nVitriols, so the residuous dark colour'd Earth,\nafter Evaporation, was insipid. The pitch of\nthe Volatility of the Spirituous part of this Water\nis observable, in that it tinctur'd with Powder\nof Galls at two days end, and suffer'd not\nby Warming, yet lost that Quality wholly in\nDistilling. Neither does this Water coagulate\nMilk: The Redness that this Water takes with\nGalls, is effected by spirituous or distill'd Acids,\nunmix'd with gross Salt, of the Soyle of a Forreign\nNature, which would disturb the Colour;\nand the larger Proportion of the Acid to the\nSteel, or the very small quantity of the last may\neffect it. But the Quantity of the Acid Spirit\nmust be judg'd here to be considerable. For the\nNature of the Acidity, I have before distinguish'd\nit by the Effects, and so need here only observe\nit to be Vitrioline, or of the Nature of Spirit of\nVitriol; which is Essential to the Precipitations.\n               \n\n                  Marks-Hall Water in Essex.\n                  THIS Water joyning another in crusts, as\ndo the rest, it is much the same with the\npreceding, containing little Steel, but a large\nshare of an Acid not so Fugitive, as where it is\nin less quantity or ill coupled with a Salt: It\ngave a bright Red a very little purplish, not so\ndeep as the preceding. The Colour it advanc'd\nwith Gall, it lost again two days after, without\nPrecipitation of any Ferrugineous parts, in which\nit differs from other Chalybeats. It rendred a\nSolution of Sal Saturni troubled, but not very\nmilky, much as the rest; and it tinctur'd a high\nYellow with Lignum Nephriticum as do Nitres,\nand a little clouded: It weigh'd likewise as the\nother, just the weight of common Water.\n\n\n                  Ilmington Water in Warwickshire.\n                  THIS Water of Ilmington being of the same\nheavy kind, and which (as I observe\nabove) require less Accuracy, I shall give the\nExamination of it, out of Dr. Derham's Account\nof it: With Syrup of Violets it turned Green;\nwith Galls Purple, like Martial Vitrioline Waters:\nIt exceeded common Water in weight\nnear half a Dram in a Pint, being weigh'd in a\ndry Season. Indeed it is much the heaviest of\nthis kind in England, (for it purges not as he\ninforms us p. 53. but by Urine.) However,\nThat it cannot vie with the lighter Chalybeats\nin Virtue, I shall explain in treating of their\nVirtues.\n                  The Water in an open Bottle drop'd its Ocre,\nand with that its power of Tinging with Galls\nin twelve hours time (that is) a great part of it,\nwhich it did not begin to do in a Bottle well stop'd\nunder a Fortnight, p. 88.\nIt yielded a Salt of an irregular shape, upon\nthe residue after distilling Acid Spirits, wrought\nwith great Effervescence, and not Alkalysat,\np. 82.\nThe Salt was pale, and would not flagrate,\np. 60. nor coagulate Milk, p. 77. The Earth\nlike Red Ocar, and is contain'd in great quantity,\na Quart yielding near a Spoonsul.\nIt appears hence, that the Salt of this Water\nis of an Alkalisat Nature, and that it differs\nfrom the Salt of Fat, Mellow or Loamy Earths,\nwhich Purge, as we shall find in the latter part\nof this History.\n\n\n                  Aylesham Water in the County of Norfolk.\n                  THIS Water is in a Gravel, it has prevail'd\nin Fame and Resort over Oulton Water\nin the same County, which is a lighter and far\nmore effectual Water, partly from the more\nconvenient Situation of the place, and partly\nfrom the wrong Estimate that is made of Chalybeat\nWaters, by those that jndge of their\nGoodness by the depth of their Tinging with\nGalls. It is heavier a little than ordinary Gravel\nWater; with Galls or Oken leaves takes a\nblew black, and makes a direct Ink; as do those\nWaters whose Salt has somewhat of the Nature\nof common Salt.\nThat the Metalline parts of these Waters are\npurely Chalybeat, I inform'd my self not in all\nbut in some, as that at Leez, and some other\nsmaller ones, by exposing to the Air the subsident\nOkar, lightly calcin'd with Sea-salt, which\nwould discover Copper if any were in it; and\nbesides by the colour they give upon Tryals\nwith Gall, the blew black colour being proper\nto Vitriol of Iron.\nThe lesser Springs of this kind are very numerous,\nin Gravelly Countries scarce a Village\nwithout one; upon the preceding Instances of\nthem, I shall make Observation of their differences,\nand the Classes they must be reduc'd\ninto, whereinto yet I did not adventure to digest\nthem, lest in the Sense of others the difference\nshould appear only gradual.\n                  These weighty Waters are either, 1. the\nmore pure and simple Acidulae, which bear less\nof the Steel; retain their Acidity longer, and\nhave not their colour with Gall dark or disturb\n•\nd,\nas the other sort, nor contain any Salt collectible;\nof this sort seems Knaresborough, and (which\nis yet the higher of this kind) Marks hall Water,\nwhich gives a thin and bright Red with Gall,\nscarce beyond a Rasberry, and loseeh its quality\nof Tinging without Precipitation of Okar,\nis of a pleasing acid Taste, as it were winy, and\nyet gives not the proof with Lignum Nephriticum\nthat Vitriols do, or Spirit of Salt, but thickish\nreddish and cloudy, as the Seminitrous Salt shot\nin Cellars.\nOr 2ly Atramentous, which give a full Black\nwith Gall, and with respect to the colour they\ngive, they are either blewish or reddish; the\nreddish, as that at Wittham, kept a Week, will\nbe thickish and turbid with Gall, but disturb not\na Solution of fine Silver in Spirit of Nitre, which\nthe Leez Water (which gives a blew black) being\nmore related to common Salt, did in a great\nmeasure precipitate.\nAnother difference that is considerable in these\nWaters, is the bulk or quantity of Salt they\ncontain, as the Illmington Water proves, which\nis not only much heavier than other Waters,\nbut varies in its Effects, and equally to the\ngrossness of the Salt, neither reaches the recesses\nof Nature so far, nor passes so well.\n                  To obviate some Objections, I shall observe,\nthat the Reason why these Waters, which are\nequally with the other sort capacitated to precipitate\nthe earthly parts out of gravelly Water,\nare not likewise equally qualified with Lightness\nby the same Vitrioline Spirit, is, because the\nSalt of these Waters is so far Vitrioline, as to\nbe apt to joyn a Chalybeat Acid and consist with\nit; but yet to be separated by Heat; and is in\nsome small measure of Nature, the same with\nthat which is an Ingredient in Vitriols; for the\nLiquor of Vitriols, if boyl'd with too great a\nFire, will precipitate their Ferrugineous parts,\nwhich the Boylers cure by adding more Iron to\nit: And these Waters, after they have drop'd\nthe Okar, and cease to tinge Galls, with Iron\nwill become Atramentous again, the first Alteration\nbeing chiefly perform'd by the Mortification\nof the Esurine Salt by the Nitrous: For besides\nthe Argument drawn from the not abiding\nof the Steel in these Waters, the Nitrous Nature\nof the Salt is conspicuous in its high colour it\ntakes with Lignum Nephriticum which Vitriols\ngive not; nor do the light Chalybeat Waters,\nthat proceed from a Ground where the Soyl is\nFat and Bituminous, as I observ'd that at Felstead\nto be, and which yields little or no Salt.\n\n\n                  Of the Waters that are Light and purely\nChalybeat.\n                  I Have clear'd the Reason of the Lightness of\nthese Waters, and with that have asserted\nthe Nature of the Spirit to be Vitrioline; since\nall those Waters are found to be so, where these\nIncrustations are found. And as the weighty\nWaters take a full high yellow Tincture from\nLignum Nephriticum, so this light sort take no\nslain with the same Wood, but retain their colour,\nonly disturb'd with a light white Cloud\nflying in it. Lignum Nephriticum makes no alteration\nin a Solution of Vitriol, nor in Water\nsharpened with Oyl of Vitriol. These Waters\ndo not well conserve their Virtue two hours,\nwhich yet will scarce be lost in ten days, if\nheaded with Oyl. They all give a purplish Red\nwith Galls, which, upon standing a while, turns\nto a purplish Black.\n\n\n                  Tunbridge Water in Kent.\n                  THIS Water gives a deep Green, with Syrup\nof Violets, as Vitriols do; and in the quantity\nof about seven Ounces and a quarter,\nweigh'd ten Grains lighter than a River-water\nnear me, (which was lighter than Spring-water)\nand as much lighter than Rain-water, and about\nfour Grains lighter than the German Spaw, to\nwhich it is preferable on that account. The\nGround above and about this Spring, is a cemented\nRock; and the Spring is large, of long\nuse, and much celebrated and frequented.\n               \n\n                  Wellenborow VVater in Northampton-shire.\n                  THIS Water weigh'd at the Spring eighteen\nGrains lighter than common Water, in a\nquantity of about twelve Ounces; with a few\ndrops of Tincture of Logwood, gave a Black;\nwith Syrup of Violets, a deep Green; with\nSyrup of Cloves, blackish; with Galls a Violet.\n\n\n                  Islington VVater.\n                  THIS Water, as the rest, makes no Alteration\nin a Solution of Sublimate, and with\nSal Saturni dissolv'd in fair Water became milky\na little, and a little curdled, and not clear as\nwith a Saltpetre; with Lignum Nephriticum it\nremain'd pale, but clouded a little with a thickish\ndusky White, near a Rain-water, and weigh'd\ntwo Grains lighter than Tunbridge Water in the\nsame quantity, which I thought might be owing\nto the difference of the Season.\n               \n\n                  Felstead VVater in Essex.\n                  THIS Water lies in a Moor, the bottom\nwhereof is a cemented Rock, the Earth\nwhere the Spring rises, is Fat and Bituminous,\nor Unctuous and very Ferrugineous, no Incrustation\nin the boggy Hole where the Water\nstands, but the Water that passes through the\nMeadow begins to incrust as it touches this\nGround: It is of the same weight exactly with\nTunbridge, it becomes milky with a Solution of\nSal Saturni, and with Lignum Nephriticum suffer'd\nno stain, but only a milky cloud swimming\nin it. This is but a small Spring, scarce more\nthan a Land-drain.\n\n\n                  Of the Virtues of the Chalybeat VVaters.\n                  THE Virtues of Steel are so very great and\nlarge, and in many cases so contrary, as\nnot to be explain'd by what are grosly call'd the\nfirst, second or third Qualities; but to help us to\na Notion of them, we must consider the Essence\nof this Mineral in its Affections, that are apparent.\nAnd thus we may conceive of it, as a hard\nbody of the Mineral Kingdom, and so qualifi'd\nwith Firmness, which is apt to enrich the Blood,\nbeing easily convertible into Fat or Sulphur, the\nnature of whose Sulphur, is to preserve Fluid\nBodies, and the Temper of whose Acid Spirit,\nis such as raises, and yet restrains or rather adjusts\nthe Fermentation of our Stomach, Soluble,\nFriendly to our Nature, and some-how Correspondent\nto the Mechanism of the Air we live in\nby its Magnetism; and then we may intelligibly\nadd the more Simple, and other evident Qualities,\nas cooling, potential Heat, Drying, Balsamick\nor Healing Quality, &c. which I shall\ntake notice of under these Heads, in these\nWaters.\n                  1. They Invigorate the Blood and Juyces as\na Chalybeat.\n2. They Astringe.\n3. They Incide and Attenuate by their Acidity.\n4. The Acidity is Connatural, and agreeable\nto the Ferment of the Stomach, and other Offices,\nwhich these Waters promote.\n5. On the same account, and partly in that it\nis Sulphurous, it is a Fraenum, or Curb, to Fermentations\nand Flatulencies, and performs more\neffectually what Oxycrate does in the Vapours\nin Women, and Spirit of Sulphur or Vitriol in\nMen, whence the Acid seems adjusted to the Temper\nof our Bodies, which can preserve the just\nFermentations, as it destroys or reduces Exorbitant\nones.\n\n6. They depurate the Juyces of forreign or\ngrosser parts, lodg'd with the Nourishment in\nthe Body, as is evident in the Stone; which is\nbut the same thing which they effect in gravelly\nWaters at their Springs.\n                  7. The Acid being Spirituous, passes where\nother Medicines cannot, and so are Diuretick\nand Exterminate, and discharge the offensive\nMatter by Urine; and the rest it Volatilizes.\n8. The Vehicle of this Mineral and Spirit,\nis not apt to Elasticity or Fermentation.\nAnd on the account of these Qualifications,\nthe Chalybeat Waters warm, strengthen, heal,\nopen Obstructions, absterge, invigorate, and\nthus are capacitated to stop Fluxes of all sorts,\nand remove many Diseases, among which the\nStone and Affectio Hypochondriaca stand at the\nHead.\nBut although all the sorts of Chalybeat Waters\nhave some Qualifications in common, as to\ninvigorate the Blood, and cleanse the Viscera;\nyet as they differ in their Salt, so likewise\nin their Virtues; which I shall particularly\ntreat of.\n\n\n                  The Virtues of the Acidulae.\n                  Which Name I would make proper to those Waters\nthat are lightly Chalybeat.\n                  THese have a fine Acidity, not collectible\ninto a Salt, the residue upon Distilling,\nbeing an Insipid Ferrugineous Earth; and as I\nsaid before, give only a Claret red with Gall.\nThat which is proper to this sort of the Chalybeat\nWaters, is, That they are free of any\ngross Salt, and have plenty of a Vitrioline Acid,\nwith little of the body of the Steel, and that\nAcid more fix'd than in the light Chalybeats.\nIn order to understand the Benefit of this, I shall\nobserve that there are Cases that require a\nWater so qualifi'd, either on the Score of the\nDistemper, or Constitution of the Patient, such\nas we commonly call Complexion; in which a\nquantity of Steel may do more harm, than the\nVitrioline Spirit can do good. And this must\nbe allow'd me, to be in all Cases and Persons,\nwhere the Blood offends in quantity, Floridness\nand Fluxilness, by every one that observes the\npower Steel has to heat and invigorate the Blood\nin the Chlorosis. And when I consider the opposite\nNature of Chalybeat Acids, and Nitrous\nSalts, as I observed before, I fansie I have a\nclear Reason for all this. One Case that the\nBody of Steel agrees not in, is that Indisposition\nof fresh-colour'd florid-complexion'd Persons,\nabout the last grand Climacterick, as I call that\nof 49, who are liable to Fluxes of Blood, or\ngreat Tumultuations of it. It is very easie to\ndiscover the Alkalisat state of the Blood in aged\nPersons, by only tasting the Urine, which in\nthose grows almost Caustick. The Diseases\nthat this sort of Water is a peculiar in, are\nApoplexies, Phrensies and Fluxes of Blood; and\nbecause the first of these is a Distemper that has\nstrangely rag'd of late, and extraordinarily this\nlast Winter, beyond what has been observ'd\nperhaps ever before, to explain the reason of it,\nso much as to give light to the Effect of these\nWaters, may be no unacceptable a Digression.\n               \n\n                  Of the Apoplexy.\n                  THE Reason of an Apoplexy, and the Cause\nof so sudden a Deprivation of Life, that\ngreat Judge, the Prince of Physicians, Hippocrates,\nresolves into a Stagnation or Station of the Blood,\nwhereby all Motion and Action of the Spirits is\ntaken away; understanding the Blood to be Spirituous,\nand as not only supplying Matter to the\nAnimal Spirits, but continually Cherishing and\nPreserving them in their Natural Disposition.\nAnd he supposes this Station of the Blood in an\nApoplexy, to be in the Vessels of the Neck and\nBreast chiefly, and that its Motion is stop'd\neither by sharp Humours, or a Plethora, or an\nAfflux of cold Humours; the last of which he\nmakes not so sudden.\n                  The Sense of the Greeks and the Arabians, I\nshall give in the words of Avicenna, transcrib'd\nout of Joh. Jacob. Wepferus.\n\nApoplexia reddit membra sensa & motu carentia,\npropter angustiam afficientem ventriculos (seu\nmedium & imum; utrumque enim vocabulum\nArabicum significat) cerebri, & canales spiritus\nsensitivi & moventis. Et Paulo inferius: Angusta\nhaec fit vel propter compressionem seu incubationem,\nvel repletionem, compressio autem, fit, si\ncorripiatur eo quod ipsum, sc. cerebrum vel dolore\nafficit, vel laedit, seu molestia aliqua vexat, vel\ncontrahit, seu constringit, sive sit qualitas ei adjuncta\naffixave celeriter spissans medicamentorum,\nsive frigus vehemens. Repletio autem est vel cum\ntumore, vel sine tumore. Repletio cum tumore est,\nsi contineatur illic materia, occludatque partini\nextensione, partim repletione. Haecque est ex speciebus\nApoplexiae gravissimae ac ejusdem notae, sive\nilla, sc. repletio à materia calida, sive frigida eveniat.\nQuae est sine Tumore, contingit vel à superfluitate\nin ipso cerebro, aut cavitatibus ejus, aut\nin propinquis canalibus spirituum ex cerebro; estque\nhaec superfluitas humor sanguineus subito in\nventriculos effusus, aut humor Phlegmaticus, atque\nhaec, superfluitas nempe, est frequentior & Potior:\nvel accidit in canalibus Spirituum ad cerebrum,\ndum interdum Venae & Arteria ex vehementi repletione\n& abundantia sanguinis obstruuntur, nec\nSpiritus, sc. vitalis, transitum habet, noc cunctatur,\nseu cessat indignari, seu turgere & effervescere:\nacciditque hoc, quod in ligatura arteriarum\nduarum Carotidum, seu soporalium, cum\namissione sensus & motus, contingit, & quando \n〈◊〉\n\nsimile obtingit a causa Primitiva, seu interna, effectum\neundem producit.\n                  The Physicians for many Ages since then,\nin an Apoplexy, accus'd only the Straightness\nand Coarctation of the Ventricles of the Brain,\ndistorting the Sense of the Ancients, and cherish'd\ntheir Opinion with the Fancy, that the\nUse of the Ventricles, was either to generate, or\ncollect and distribute the Animal Spirits. But after\nthat the Varolian Method in cutting the Brain\nbegan to be practis'd, the Ventricles were discharg'd\nfrom these Uses, by Platerus, Bauhi\n••\n\n▪\nSpigelius, and others; but most happily by\nD. Caspar Hoffmannus, and had assign'd to them\nonly the Office of Receptacles of the Excrements.\nAgainst him, the former Uses of them,\nthe Famous Anatomist Joh. Riolanus fil. endeavour'd\nto maintain: The ground that his Argument\nproceeds upon is, That the Animal Spirit\nis made out of the Vital, and that this is deduced\nby the Carotid Arteries to the Basis of\nthe Brain; and then that the Ventricles are aptly\nsituate to this end, to receive and conveigh the\nSpirits into the fourth Ventricle as a Cistern,\nthat thence they may be distributed into the\nNerves. And so he carries it on, At Nervorum\nseptem Conjugationes propagantur ab illis eminentiis\nquat \n••\nr, quarum duae majores formant clauduntque\nlatera Ventriculorum anteriorum; aliae\nduae constituunt latera quarti ventriculi, cujus tectum\npartesque anticas & posticas efformat duplex\nScolicoidis Apophysis. And for the conveyance\nof the Blood thither, A reti mirabili numerosam\nsobolem ramorum arteriosorum, undequaque per\ndurum matrem spargi, qui sanguinem suum depo\n\n•\nant\nin sinum tertium: ab eo sinu depromi innumeros\nrivulos, qui sparsi per exteriores anfractus\ncerebri, roris instar, destillent sanguinem arteriosum\nsuperne deorsum: praeterea per torcular, venam\nmagnam Galeni, seu sinum quartum sanguinem\n& Spiritus ad ventriculos deduci. But all\nthis with a violent Strain to Reason and Anatomical\nTruth, much Indistinctness and Inconsistency\nwith himself; What means the destilling\nof the Blood, the Sponginess of the Eminencies\nthat conveigh the Spirits to the Nerves?\nThe Spirits sometimes confin'd to the Ventricles;\nsometimes diffus'd to the whole Brain. What\nelse is his allowing the Ventricles to receive the\nExcrementitious Moisture, which he had separated\nfor a nobler use; his deriving the Blood\ninto the Plexus Choroideus, from the Sinus quartus,\nwith the pernicious Consequence that\nwould attend it if it were so. With other\nslips of like nature, Et quie praeterea Spirituum\nAnimalium opifex esset in corpore, ex minutissi\n•\nis\nvenulis & arteriolis tenuissima membrana & exiguis\nglandulis composito? Vnde suppeteret mattria?\nQua via distribuetur Spiritus in Nervos null\n•\n\nmodo ipsi continuous, quibus sedibus includetur, ubi\nnecessarium, huc illucve depromendus? But of\nthe Office of the Ventricles, and Seat of Animal\nSpirits, we receive better Information from Ho\n••\n\nmannus,\nwho against him argues.\n                  1. Ibi fit Spiritus ubi Actio. At vero in corpore\nfit. Corpus enim agit non accidens.\n2. Spiritus si agere debet, oportet sub imperit\nanim\n•\n maneat, sc. in vasis.\n3. Ventriculi cinguntur interius pia matre.\n4. Ab exitu Spirituum in palatum.\n5. Ventriculos cum Nervis non esse continuos,\nsed cum corpore.\n6. Ventriculos habere aliud officium & incongr\n•\num.\nThe Arguments are fairly laid down at large\nin Wepferus; and are nevertheless valid; though\nI see no reason altogether to be satisfied in the\nUses here and generally assign'd the Ventricles,\nsince as it is observ'd by that Curious Anatomist\nDr. Ridley, no Water can be express'd from the\nGlandula Pituitaria, nor has it any aperture discoverable\ninto the Palate, which confirms this,\nthat he never found Water in the Infundibulum,\neither in the Sound or Unsound. For besides\nthat, there is a Parity in the Reasons of the Use\nof them by him assign'd, or that well can be\nassign'd, the Vesicae found in the Ventricles of\nvertiginous Cattle, and the great quantity of\nWater, In puero integrè mentis munia obeunte,\nmention'd by Tulpius, and cited by the foresaid\nAuthor, evacuate the Nobility of their Office.\nAnd Galen, whose Notion in this Matter is not\nconsistent, yet relates, Adolescentem Smyrnensem\nad alterutrum ventriculorum usque vulneratum,\nsemet oculato teste, superstitem permansissie. And\nagain observes, In soporibus & Epilepsia ventres\nmagis, corpus cerebri minus affici solet; in Apoplexia\nvero corpus magis. And this easie to be\nclear'd in the Formation of Brains of Brutes.\nWepferus, by the help of Dissections, detects\nthe Seat of this Disease in the Brain it self, considering\nthe whole Compage in Contradistinction\nonly to the ventricles, and asserts a true Apoplexy\nto be generated, Ab effuxu Spirituum totali\nad instrumenta sensus & motus praepedito, quod\nfiet ob principii omnium Nervorum vel Obstructionem\nvel compressionem subito factam, unde denegatis\nSpiritibus Animalibus, quamvis abundent\n\n•••\nles, Apoplexia sequitur. And this Stoppage,\naccording to him, may be either at the Pores of\nthe Medulla that admit the Arteries, or are open\nto them; or those through which they are distributed\ninto the Nerves. This Hypothesis\nlabours under many Difficulties, suggested both\nfrom Reason and Experience; for as it is necessary\nthat the Seat of the Animal Spirits should\nbe exempt from any forreign Intrusion, so Nature\nseems to have secur'd it, like the Palace of\nPrinces, by previous passes. Neither does the\nBrain appear lyable to the Inconveniencies that\nother Secretory Glands are from their own Acidity,\nor Admission of less prepar'd or grosser\nJuyces, which procure their Obstructions. And\naccordingly we do not find, that a Colluvies of\nSerum, or a Scrumous Brain to have induc'd\nthis Distemper: And even in that plainer case,\nwhich is allow'd, where an Apoplexy proceeds\nfrom a Plethora, and a Weakness of the Brain,\nI have always found some farther Explication\nnecessary; as to account why so sudden, why\nnot in all Ages and Seasons, and the like. And\non the other hand, that the Brain cannot want a\nsufficient Afflux of Blood, Nature, as in other\nparts, so here, hath made provision, as by Anatomy\nappears. Our great Dr. Willis hath in\nmy Judgment clear'd this Point, by two Instances,\none of an Obstructed Artery, without\nan Impediment to the Course, or at least a sufficient\nAfflux of the Blood; The other of an Apoplexy,\nwithout any appearance of Obstruction\nor disorder in the Brain: And more closely tr\n•\n\ncing\nthe Seat of this Distemper to the Origin\n•\n\nof Sense and Motion, hath fix'd it in the Medit\n•\nllium\ncerebri. And besides that, there is the\nSpring of Life, there is good reason to excuse\nthe Cortical part, since Instances are frequent,\nin Authors unquestionable, of Portions of it\ntaken out at Wounds of the Head, without\nany pernicious Consequence. And therefore\nwhereas Dr. Cole is pleas'd to suppose, that\nthe Seat of the Distemper, as where the Cause\nthat influentially occasions the Defection of Natures\ndue Actings first fixes it self; I do not see\nit essential to this Distemper, to be an Affection\nof this part; but with deference to that very\nLearned and Excellent Physician, must observe\nthat the Enemy sometimes escapes this Secretion,\nwithout leaving any marks of its footing;\nand therefore am inclin'd with Dr. Willis to\nplace it In aut prope cerebri Meditullium, upon\nthe entrance of which it exerts its power. But\nif he pleases to consider the Cortical part as it\nis Secretory, and as it is first affected in a gradual\nor habitual Apoplexy, I think that must be\nallow'd. Dr. Willis then proceeds to induce a\nProfligation of the Spirits, to solve the sudden\nand light assault of this Distemper. An Apoplexy\nhe distinguisheth into Accidental and Habitual,\nwhich he considers sine Procatarxi, or\nwith an Antecedent Cause. The Causa conjuncta\n& proxima aut est magna Solutio continui\nalicubi intra aut prope cerebri meditullium\ncontingens, propter quam, poris obstructis aut compressis,\nemanatio omnis supprimitur, vel est ingens\nas subita spirituum in Cerebro degentium profligatio\naut extinctio. [Another Species that may\nbe temporary, he supposes an Affection of the\nCerebellum.] The Solutio continui is either\nfrom Blood, an Aposthem, or 3ly, a Serous\nColluvies. The reason of an Extemporaneous\nApoplexy, he assigns in the Conjunct Causae,\nIn Paroxysmo materiam congestam in ambitu cerebri\nprius aggestam & dispersam demum in Meditullium\nejus d\n•\nscendre, ibidemque spiritus omnes\nadoriri & in ipso emanationis suae fonte supprimere\n& prosternere, et si non plane constat, utrum\nillud efficiat aut medullae poros tantum infarciendo,\naut Spiritus istos profligando iisque narcosin infligendo,\nverisimile utroque modo. His Procatarctic.\nSanguis in vitio vel cerebrum in crasi imbecillum\n& secundum poros & meatus ejus laxum\n& solutum nimis, materiam morbificam absque\nrepudio admittit. That happy Author, the\nabove-mentioned Dr. Cole, in his Treatise occasion'd\nby the late Frequency of Apoplexies, by\nhis Inquiry into the Materiae Morbificae indoles,\nhath not a little illustrated the Cause of this Distemper.\nHis Sense, as I understand it, is this,\nFrom Observation made of the Weekly Bills of\nMortality, he dates the Aera of their Increase\nfrom 1683. Upon which Substratum he naturally\ndeduces the Cause of this Distemper from Cold,\nand observes that to account for it very well.\nIn order to the understanding the Nature of\nCold, he reduces the Notion of it to these Considerations.\n                  1. That Sensible Qualities, though they are\nnot among the general Affections of Matter, as\nMotion, Rest, Bulk, Figure, &c. yet are consequent\nto it, but determin'd by these, and associated\nto somewhat that has Perception.\n2. As Cold makes an Impression on our Sensories,\nso it requires Motion; and it is not Motion\nsimply, but consider'd with some adjunct,\nviz. Motion in such or such a Degree, and with\nrelation to Sensitive Beings that constitutes Heat.\n\n3. The Transmission of these Impressions to\nthe Soul, requires a Motion in our Organs, but\nsuch a one as may keep up a due Crasis in both\nthe Fluid and Consistent Substances, that make\nup the Organ for the performing the Functions\nappointed.\n                  4. That these Congenial Motions seem not\nproperly Objects of our Perception, but rather\nInstruments of Transmission of those others\nfrom without, which recede from these Degrees,\nor are otherwise Circumstantiated:\nThough these deflecting from their due Proportion,\nmay, by affecting the Soul differently from\nwhat they use to do, excite her to take notice of\nthem too.\n5. That these mean Motions are to us a Standard\nof all others.\nFrom all which, our Author deduces Cold to\nbe a Check of that degree, which belongs to\nthe Parts of, and Fluid Substances in our Sensories\nof Touching; and Heat to be an Acceleration;\nand the Bulk and Figure of the Bodies\nthat cause either to be considerable. The Retardation\nwhich makes the Nature of Cold, may\nbe occasion'd by increase of bulk and change of\nFigure, by Adhesion. 2 By altering the due\nContexture of the Vessels. 3. If the affecting\nBodies be of such a Figure and Texture as to\nbe flexible. 4. By Interposing they may fill\nthe Spaces, and may be the present Case. Now\nas Conical or Pyramidal Figures solve this\nPhaenomenon best, so he gives the Nitrous parts\nof the Air those Figures, from des Carte's Notion,\nand Lewenhook's Microscopical Autopsy.\nTo enquire how our Bodies and Brain are\naffected by these, he observes the Air to affect\nas Liquors.\n                  1. The Blood, into which it is admitted by\nthe Stomach, by the Lungs and Pores of the\nSkin; and on which it operates partly by the\nInsinuation of its Elastical and other Irregular\nParticles, partly by the Interposition as well as\nLancination of the Nitrous Ra\n•\nous Parts, which\npromotes the Comminution of it, whereby the\nCrasis of it may be alter'd, if such Air be admitted\nas shall over-check this Agitation.\n2. The Nervous Juyce, which he supposes\nlyable to Impressions, in some degree analogous\nto what are made on the Blood from Substances\nmix'd with it. He supposeth some of the admitted\nSubstances of the Air may be deposited\ninto the Nerves at their Original; or that it must\ncommunicate with the Blood, in receiving some\nof the Viscous parts produced in it by the Air;\nand that some more subtile Particles must be admitted\nthrough the Pores. To which the same\nworthy Author adds, That he conceives them\nin some due Proportion necessary to the due\nSpiritualization of this Juyce. Again, The solid\nparts are lyable to the same Inconvenience, and\nto retain them longer.\nLastly, The Brain may be affected not only\nby the Mediation of the Blood, but also by the\nAirs affecting the Mammillary Processes, or the\nEars, or the Extremities of the Nerves in all\nparts of the Skin. And this pressure of the Air\nmay be unequal, some part of it being mov'd\nwith greater Violence, where is greater Dilatation,\nor a part kept warmer: And this Injury\nof Air, Tenderness and ill Digestion, through\nwant of Exercise, makes the Body obnoxious\ntoo. And thus the Brain may suffer in that\nContinuity, due Confirmation and Repletion of\nits parts, wherein this Author supposes the tone\nof the parts to consist. So that in the Author's\nown words, as well as Sense, The part affected\nmay either be the whole Brain, or any considerable\npart of it, and either the Cortical or\nMedullar, but especially (or at least first) the\nCortical, from whence the disaffected Matter is\ntransmitted to the parts of it which lye deeper,\nwhere the Animal Spirits principally exert themselves;\nthe Nature of the Distemper to consist\nin the sudden Abolition of the due Excrasie and\nDistribution of th\n••\n thence; the immediate\nCause, most usually (when unavoidably fatal)\nan Effusion of Blood out of its Vessels upon the\nSubstance of the Brain. Though I conceive (says\nhe) a bare \n〈◊〉\n of the Arteries there may\noccasion it, as also may perhaps a Congestion of\nViscous or Serous Matter, when it comes to a\nconsiderable degree, and becomes freshly excited;\nor else Polypous Concretions, or (if we\ncan suppose it) any other obstructing Matter\ndeposited in it, may at last produce it; and the\nPre disposition of the Brain to it, to consist\nusually in the more than ordinary Laxity or\nOpenness of it. And whatsoever either first\ncauses a Congestion of Blood, or 2ly, otherwise\nso Indisposes it, that it cannot readily and duly\ncirculate through its usual Vessels in the Brain;\nor 3ly, disaffects the Brain, whether by weakning\nits Tone, or altering the Figures of its\npassages, or straitning them too much, may occasion\nApoplexies: And the greater Urgency or\nViolence of such antecedent Causes, may introduce\na greater Frequency of them than ordinary.\n                  Thus I have given the Notions of this Distemper\ndistinctly, for these Reasons;\n1. It sets the Distemper, as we do a Picture,\nin all Lights, to try which way we may see it\nbest. And,\n2. As it prepares to the understanding of\nApoplexies, so in my further Inquiry, in many\nparticulars, Repetition will be sav'd, and less\nintelligible Parentheses avoided.\n3. We may, by this means, observe the Specifick\nSymptoms of this Distemper, and what\nhints they gave these Authors.\nInformation being not to be gain'd by Controversie,\nI shall not inspect the Particulars of\nthese Accounts, in which they are not Satisfactory,\nas why, after that Frost, and not preceding\nones, why the Aera should be then fix'd,\nand yet the Increase began long before. Why\nthe Head should be affected, and not other parts\nrather; it being necessary to account for the\nReason, why Air afflicts one part particularly,\nas we see the Fauces and Throat at the Alps,\nthe Lungs at Rome. So likewise of the Changes\nof the Distempers which are temporary, and\nmany other things; but shall offer some Observations,\nwhich I submit to the Judgment of the\nlast cited Author and others, which, if approv'd,\ngive a more natural account, and may carry on\nthe Inquiries; and they are such as answer two\nQuestions or Inquiries.\n                  1. Of the Reason of the sudden and accidental\nDeath.\n2. That may inform us of the Indoles of the\nMorbifick Matter, and how much is observable\nin the Air that can answer for this.\nMy Notion, as to the first of these, is deduced\nfrom these Considerations.\n1. That the Motion of the Blood is necessary\nto Life.\n2. That this is owing to Respiration.\n3. That Respiration is necessary to Life.\n4. Both Motion of the Blood, and Necessity\nof Respiration, consist in the Elasticity of the\nAir.\n5. I observe, that besides the Atmospherical\nAir, that is exhausted by a Pneumatick Engine,\nthere is a finer Elastick Air or Matter contain'd\nin this Atmospheric Air, which in an exhausted\nReceiver hindred the parting of the Marbles,\nwhich is Elastick too, the pressure being ad\nmodum, or in Proportion to the force that is\ncapable to separate the cohering Bodies,\nand may be surmounted by a force superi\n•••\n\nto it.\n                  6. There seems to be a Nitre in the Air,\nnecessary to maintain and share in produci\n•\n\nthe Elasticity of the grosser Atmosphere, which\nbeing consum'd, an Animal dies.\n7. There are certain Termini & fines of the\nTenuity and Grossness of the Air, on this side\nof which, or beyond, the Air becomes \n〈◊〉\n\nfor the Respitation of Animals. Thus Fish\nthat die in an open Air, yet are choak'd for\nwant of it, if a Pond Freeze; and accordingly\nare provided with Pipes, that strain the \n〈◊〉\n\nMatter, and are stronger, and not lyable to the\nInconvenience from the force and weight of\nthe Water. And lastly, as the Matter drawn\nis finer, so there is no need of the Contraction\nand Opening, or Conquassation of the Air, to\nget the Matter out they want, which is strain'd\nby the Water.\n8. I observe, that Animals which have a\nCrasis of Blood, to which less Nitre is requisite,\nas they can be long without Food, so can\nlive a considerable time without Air, as Tortoises,\nAdders, &c. and therefore have membranous\nLungs, in which no more Blood circulates,\nthan is required for their Nourishment,\nand so not the whole Blood, as in those that have\nfleshy Lungs.\n9. This Elasticity is requisite to Life, as it\nkeeps in a Springy Motion, and so Life ceases,\neither upon a Stoppage of the Air Externally,\nas in a Glass, or Internally, as we see is the\nEffect of Damps, which by some, and those\ngreat Men, have, by mistake, been conceiv'd\nto contain Poysonous Matter, and to perform\nit on that account, but the contrary is evident,\nsince in Pump-wells the Water is wholsome, and\na new built House, from the Lime and Mortar,\nshall have the same.\n                  10. On the same Reason, Animals dye in\nthe exhausted Receiver, upon the unbending\nthe Spring, by Exhaustion. And it is worthy\nremark, that Animals taken out before expiring,\nare not recover'd by admission of the\nAir, which affects not soon enough the lesser\nor remoter Springyness. Acad. del cimento.\n\n11. That the Parts and Juyces of Animals\nare Elastick, appears to me asserted in the Experiments\nof the Honourable Mr. Boyle.\n\n12. That Air is admitted to the Blood, I\nneed no other Argument, but that the Blood continues\nto follow upon Bleeding.\n13. That the Air is not admitted to the Brain\nand Nerves, or to any of the Specifick Juyce\nof the Animal, I argue again from the like\nreason.\nFrom all which I deduce, that an Apoplexy\nis produced by the admission of Air, or Elastick\nParts, to the Medulla or Corpus Callosum of the\nBrain And that this Air and Lethiserous parts\nare admitted by the Mouth, and so by the way\nof the Stomach, appears plainly, in that the Fits\nusually seize immediately upon plentiful Feeding.\nFor the Glutinous parts of the Chyle are a fit\nVehicle, as being, if ill concocted, Flatulent\nand Elastick, as I shall farther demonstrate,\nwhen I come to the Affectio Hypochondriaca.\nAnd I must take notice of the Consistency\nof this Notion, which is confirm'd by that Affection\nso often passing into this Distemper.\nThat this sudden Death comes not from the\nother Causes I named, is evident from many\nReasons, which I have not room here for:\nThe most difficult Phoenomenon to be solv'd,\nthat appears to me, is the Apoplexy seizing\nFaemellae upon the difficulty of Eruption of the\nCatamenia, at the second Septenary. To which\nwe can only say, that the Plethora is apparent,\nand the Weakness of the Brain, though we see\nnot how the Brain, and Genus Nervosum, is concern'd\nin this, nor know its Motion; for I\nallow the antecedent Causes of a Turgid Blood,\nand a weak Brain, to have place in this Distemper.\nThis my Hypothesis, I think, naturally\nconsequent to the just Notions of the Air and\nBrain, and well accounts for the Spuma at the\nNostrils and Mouth, and for the Difficulty of\nBreathing, or Cessation of Respiration attended\nwith an entire Pulse, which thus may be carried\non, and the main Design of Respiration cease.\nThis gives the reason of the Distention of the\nLungs in the Apoplectick that is mention'd by\nWepferus, if the Elasticity of the Internal parts\nof the Lungs, can but be supposed to do the\nsame that the removing of the Incumbent\nAtmosphere in an exhausted Receiver did on\nsome Animals, in which the Academy del Cimento\nobserv'd the Lungs to swell, and to Forth\nat the Mouth: And thus we may solve the\nDifficulty observ'd by the Ancients, why this\nDistemper affects only the Chest or Breast.\nThe only thing that we want to be satisfied\nof is, secondly, what that is in the Air that\ninduces this Distemper now to be so rise,\nwhence we may come at the Indoles materiae\nmorbisicae. And that I may not enter into that\nvast Field, of the Cause of Seasons, and the\nlike Effects, which are taken into the Hand\nof God's particular Providence to manage, I\nshall confine my self to be guided by these few\nRemarks:\n                  1. That no Affections of the Air, or Qualities\nin it, depend on any Mixture of Mineral\nVapours, because they precipitate immediately;\nneither do we find the places where are large\nEruptions of them, any whit Sicklier, or affected,\notherwise than other places: And then,\nall Distempers are otherwise Solvable.\n2. That the Qualities of the Air, that affect\nour Bodies, consist not in, nor always with;\nthose that may be supposed to belong to the\ngrosser Air of our Atmosphere. I have known\nAnimals frequent some Years in a hard Frost,\nwhich would be suppos'd to be pernicious to\nthem; and not only my self, but that most extraordinary\nNaturalist, and universally great\nMan, and my honoured Friend, Mr. Ray, hath\nobserved, that some Years the hardest Frost hath\nnot hindred the Papilio's from coming out of\ntheir Chrysitis, which in some mild Springs,\nshall not be found abroad so soon. This is\nthe more fit Instance to prove what I say, must\nbe acknowledged by any that have observed the\nnecessity of Heat, and how much it contributes\nto the Production of this Change.\n                  3. That there are some Qualities in the Air\nalways, which are owing to the parts more\nintimately mix'd with it, than is the Nitre,\nthat affects us with Cold, and which passeth\nwhere the grosser is not admitted. This is observable\nin the Effects it has on Liquors, which\nthe Managers of them are forced to have recourse\nto, for the reason of the Disposition to\nferment, or fret, or Incapacity of either, Acidity\nand the like. All which some Years, Liquors,\nespecially Cyder, is propense to, be the Weather\nwhat it will.\n4. That Heat and Cold, Wetness or Dryness\nof Seasons, assist in inflicting a Disease, as they\nmay help admit these Particles.\n5. That I have observ'd these Qualities of\nthe Air to be Temporary, and the Diseases\neffected by the Air to be so too, and that in\ntheir Continuation and Variation they usually\nobserve the Direction of both Causes, the Nature\nof the Humour in succeeding Distempers\nbeing usually traceable, as the Variation of it is\nlikewise accountable.\n\nNow although I can by no means maintain,\nthat the Hypothesis of that Learned and Ingenious\nMan, agrees with the Rise and Continuance\nof this Distemper, or is sufficient to\nexplicate it, nor can answer for the Non-appearance\nof the Distemper before upon the\nsame occasion. Yet that it was a fair offer at\nthe Truth, and affords a good hint, is remarkably\nto be taken notice of, in that this Winter, in\nwhich more have died Apoplectick, and that\nin the Country, than ever was taken notice in\nMan's Memory, or deliver'd to have been in\nany Age; I say that this Winter should be,\nthough not the hardest, yet remarkably long,\ndoes seem to make the Nitrous Air a sharer in\nthe Cause. But as I except against the Explication\nof this Distemper, by bare Obstruction\nor Stagnation from Cold, as not sufficient, so I\ncome now to inquire, what farther knowledge\nof this the Air will afford us, assisted by the\npreceding Considerations, and to see how they\nanswer here, and how far the Footsteps and\nChanges are discoverable. And as Truth is\nnot surely to be laid hold on, but when pursued\nby a natural Method, so I wave all Hypothesis,\nand only propose this Maxim or Rule to direct\nme, which I take to be too necessary a Deduction,\nto be deem'd a begging of the Principle.\nThe Air that is productive of a Distemper,\nmust produce some other Effects in differing or\nless prepar'd Constitutions, and not hit only\nwhere it can fully execute; and the Disposition,\nParticles, or Qualities of the Air may reasonably\nbe inquir'd of these Effects, as Prints of its\nfooting.\n                  The Diseases then that have been inflicted by\nthe Air this Winter, have been Feavers [which\nI shall say nothing more of, than that the Heat\nwas gentle, that they were Putrid, and had\nputrid Pains in the Sides and Limbs, and that\nthey affected the Head] or ulcerating Colds, so\nI name them, being of two sorts, the first violent\nFluxes of the Alvus, and Catamenia, the\nother Ophthalmys, which wore off in three weeks\ntime by Suppuration. And lastly, The Small\nPox, which appears here a mixture of the preceding\nDistempers, or Qualities in the Air; for\nthe Air here gives these remarkable Dispositions,\n1. to Corrode, 2. to attenuating, whereby\nthe parts seem to pierce to the Eyes and\nBowels. 3. To Flatulency, all which include\na tendency to flow. Which Qualities, as with\nmany reasons I concluded to be Nitrous, so\nVitriols mortified or resisted; and even those\nFluxes of the Catamenia, which in another reason\nSteel is observ'd to raise and increase, submitted\nonly to the force of the same Mineral;\nwhich I was directed to by some further Observation\nof the Air, which is too long for this\nDiscourse: Though the increase of some Fluxes\nof this kind, upon the taking Sal Prunellae, which\nusually gives a present check, is enough to advance\nsuch a Hint. The last Year, viz. 1697.\nentred attended with a particular sort of Colds,\nthat induc'd an irregular Feaverishness; with\nmilinary Pimples spreading upon some particular\nplaces of the Body, so close and so small,\nas to resemble a stain of Claret or other Scarlet\nLiquor; which superceded by Tumour of other\nparts, and Sickness, in some prov'd Mortal.\nAt the same time another Distemper was found\ninvading, though Sparsim only, which began\nabout the Michaelmas preceding, and continued\nto the middle of the last Year, which first invaded\nthe Patient with want of Rest only, and\nunaptness of the Brain for it, wherein the Patient\nthat was entirely well up, and had no complaint,\nbut upon lying down and disposure to\nslumber, was sensible of such Distraction and\nUneasiness of the Head, as oblig'd him to fly\nup immediately. This Distemper continuing,\nbrought a Cough without raising, and a sort of\nan Icteritia, with Shortness of Breath, and frequent\nand sudden Apprehensions of a Deliquium.\nThe Year 1696 enter'd with the same sort of\nColds, and with the Spring brought Epileptick\nDistempers, which wore off with Scabbiness;\nand many People, Young and Old, were surpriz'd\nwith Vertigo's; and others with Tumours\nin the Throats, and corroding Ulcers,\ncurable by Astringents only that were Vitrioline.\nIn 1695 Deliriums were frequent. In\n1694 Feavers that seem'd to have their Seat in\nthe Glands, and were attended with great Acidity\nof the Saliva or Liquor of the Tonsillae. And\nfrom three Years before reign'd Nervous Rheumatisms,\na Distemper very unusual, from the\nacuteness of the Pain; the mortal Consequence\nof them, and the puffiness of the Tumours,\nvery remarkable: This Disease hath continued\nhitherto, but abating.\n                  I engage not my self to solve or account for\nall these Changes of Diseases, or the reason of\nthem; it is sufficient that none of these Cases\nwere attended with any apparent Feaver, the\nMatter was in all seated in the Membranes, the\npart affected in all was puffy, the Distempers\nfrequently chang'd one into another, affected\nthe Head and Nerves, cur'd by the same means,\nwhich were Vitriolick, and were admitted by a\nwet Constitution of the Air. So without making\ninquiry into the Origine and Commencement\nof this Disposition, and Reason of it, it is\nsufficient that I illustrate the Seat and Nature\nof this Distemper, and I think I must be allow'd\nthat these Diseases proceeded from the same\ncommon Cause and Humour, and were transferrible\ninto each other, and have liberty to\nconclude first, That this Peccant Humour was\nseated in the Membranes. 2. That it was flatulent,\nand had a flatulent Acidity. 3. That\nthe Matter was Nitrous. Neither think I my\nself oblig\n•\nd, to account for the Determination\nof the Seat of this Humour, or the reason of\ntaking Cold, but shall from the evident Causes,\nMatter and Seat of it, inferr,\n\nThat an Apoplexy is a sudden Deprivation\nof Life, by admission of Airy\nElastick Parts into the Caudex Cerebri,\ntogether with Thick and Turgid Chyle,\nand is owing to a Corrosive Nitrosity\nand Fluor of the Blood, and Weakness\nof the Vessels, or containing Parts of\nthe Caudex effected by Cold, the way\nbeing firs forced in the anterior part of\nthe Cortex.\nI think this a sufficient Notion of it as a\nDisease, but contradict not the difference that\nmust be made of Apoplexies inflicted by Force,\nas Drinking, &c. or gradual ones.\nHaving thus fix'd the Nature of the Distemper,\nthe Intentions of Cure are drawn from the\nMorbid Dispositions, which are,\n1. Nitrosity of the Blood, which indeed is\nthe Reason it is so very Florid in Apoplexies;\nand to this is owing its Fluidity.\n2. The Weakness of the Vessels from Cold\nreceived by them, and by this I understand a\nClog of a disabled Serum, considering the Nature\nof Cold in gross, as separating the Juyces,\nand so mortifying them, as to put them past Reduction.\n3. The Exorbitancy of Chyle, that maintains\nand conveighs Elastick Flatulent Parts.\nAll which indicate the Astriction, and other\nQualities I observ'd before to be in Vitrioline\nWaters, and the Requisites that capacitate\nthem for all this, are in full Virtue only found\nin this \n•\npecies; where the Astriction is strongest,\nand the quantity of Steel not so considerable,\nas to increase the Heat or Turgency of the\nBlood, in both which this kind exceed the other\ntwo; though I cannot but judge, that a Premission\nof the thin light sort, may in some cases\nassist in more effectual preparatory Cleansing\nthe Brain, and be very properly directed to\nprecede. Indeed the Hypochondriaca Affectio\ndoes so often dispose to this Distemper, that\nas it will confirm much this Account, so will\nmuch recommend this Method. It does not\nbelong to this History, to deliver an entire Process\nor Method of Cure, nor am I so opinionated\nof my own Ability, as to prescribe it to\nothers of my Faculty; yet because this Discourse\nmay come into other Mens hands, that\nmay judge this Digression Fruitless, without\nsome Improvement of it, I shall, for the sake\nof the Fury and Suddenness of this Distemper,\ngive some Observations of mine, that may help\nto occurr or prevent it, or assist, at least, in\nshortning the Process, and fit it for an Extemporany\nOccasion. And though as Cases may\nmuch differ, so a Plethora Sanguinis, Colluvies\nSerosa, or Viscous Phlegm, Obstruction of the\nCatamenia, and the like, is to be consulted when\nthey are in the Cause; yet the checking the\nFury of the Blood, as well as clearing the passages\nto the Brain, is best performsd by Chalybeats,\nand to more good Effect, than by Bleeding,\n&c. and differ not so much in the Cure, as\nthey seem to do in the Cause; and my Observations\nI shall deliver briefly thus.\n                  1. That for Prevention (besides the removing\nany known Cause or Occasion) the best\nDeobstruents are such as joyn and mix with the\nMatter they are to exterminate; of this sort\nis Sapo venet, and Vrines humane, or perhaps\nof other Animals; and these to be promoted to\nthe use of Chalybeat Astringents, where these\nWaters claim their place. Only I must mind\nthe Reader, that if such a Relaxation of the\nVessels of the Brain attend it, as appears by\npreceding vertiginous Warnings, I must after\nthe use of the Waters, dismiss the Patient to\nMr. Boyle's Ens, which in the preceding Distempers\nof the Membranes of the Brain, I have\nexperienc'd to be most Effectual.\n2. As the other Method is to prevent and\nrestore, so for the present Relief in the Assault,\nEmeticks and Catharticks usually distinguish\nthemselves: The other general and particular\nEvacuations fall not under my Cognizance, writing\na System being not my design, yet Sternutatories\nmust not escape my Reflection, which\nI have ever observed to hasten the approaching\nDeath, to which the Nature, as well as the\nViolence of the Motion made by Sneezing, dispose\nthem; and are fit only to put the Patient\npast Remedy with speed. And as this Monition\nis necessary here, so a due Caution about\nDiet, which forbids eating Pork, or Eggs, \n〈◊〉\n\nMeat of thick, high and flatulent Nourishment,\nis necessary to be observ'd with respect to Prevention.\nOther Particulars that regard the\nConstitution of the Patient, or Predisposition to\nthis Distemper that the Physician is to judge of,\nlye not here before me. Thus much as to the\nApoplexy.\n                  There are many other Distempers, wherein\na Water of this kind is peculiarly proper to\nmaster and remove flatulent and viscous Matter,\nand to curb the Turgescence of a florid Blood,\nas in the Cephalick Disorders of Elder Women,\n&c. and that I may not proceed upon Suggestions\nof Reason only, I shall recite the Virtues\nof Knaresborow Water from the Observation of\nDr. French, in his words.\n\nThis Water Cools and Moistens actually,\nHeats and Dries potentially, and according\nto other Qualities, second and third, it cuts,\ndissolves, attenuates, abstergeth, viscous tartarous\nHumours in the Stomach, Mesentery,\nHypochondries, Reins, Bladder, &c. Penetrates,\nCorroborates, Astringeth, &c. It\nallays all acid, gnawing and hot Humours,\nand Cures all such Symptoms as proceed from\nthence, as Agues, Consumptions, Quinsies,\nTumours, Imposthumes, Ulcers, Wounds;\nit stops Bleeding, the Over-flowing of Choller,\nthe Dissentery, and such like Fluxes.\n\n\nIt Corroborates the Brain, Nerves, &c.\nand prevents or cures the Apoplexy, Epilepsie,\nPalsie, Vertigo, Inveterate Headach,\nand Madness; and all such Symptoms as proceed\nfrom the Weakness, Coldness, Heat,\nDryness or Moisture of the same.\n\nIt Corroborates the Stomach, and causeth\ngood Digestion, consumes Crudities, which\nare the Causes of Obstructions, and breed ill\nBlood and infirm Flesh, or an ill habit of\nBody; it maketh the Fat Lean, and the Lean\nFleshy; cureth and preventeth the Cholick and\nWorms.\n\n\nIt strengthneth and openeth the Lungs,\nLiver, Spleen, Mesentery, and cureth difficulty\nof Breathing, the Asthma, the Dropsie,\nMelancholly and fearful Passions, Hypochondriacal\nWind and Vapours (offending the Head\nand Heart) which most Women and many\nMen are afflicted withall. It doth also upon\nthis account chear the Heart, cure and prevent\nthe Palpitations and Passions thereof, as\nalso all Faintings.\n\n\nIt purifieth the Blood, cures the Scurvy,\neven in those whose Teeth are ready to drop\nout of their Heads, by reason of the Extremity\nthereof; also the Foul Venereal Disease,\nLeprosie, Jaundies Yellow and Black, and for\nthe more perfect effecting of these Cures, it\ndoth in many open the Haemorrhoids.\n\n\nIt provoketh Urine, and cureth the Suppression,\nand allays the Sharpness thereof;\n\n〈1 page duplicate〉\n\n\n〈1 page duplicate〉\n\nit diminisheth the Stone in the Bladder, by\ndissolving the soft Superficial parts thereof,\nand evacuating that mucous slimy Water in\nwhich it is involved, and by this means also\nit prepares it for Cutting, for sometimes this\nStone cannot be felt, by reason of that slimy\nMucous, which Mucous it self doth also sometimes,\nby its Torments, counterfeit the Stone,\nwhere it is collected in a great quantity, being\nof an acid tartarous Nature. It forceth out\nfrom the Kidneys and Bladder abundance of\nSand and small Stones to a great number, and\nsometimes such as are as big and as long as\nlong Pepper. And as it cures all Ulcers and\nWounds in the Body, so especially, and much\nsooner, in the Reins and Bladder; suppressing\nalso the Pissing of Blood, and the Gonorrhaea.\n\n\nIt cures the Gout, Aches, Cramp, Convulsion\nin what part of the Body soever, and\ngiveth ease therein suddenly.\n\n\nIt openeth all Obstructions, and suppresseth\nall manner of Over-flowings in Women,\nstrengthneth, cureth the Mother, maketh the\nBarren Fruitful, and is a great Preventative\nagainst Miscarryings, and rectifies most Infirmities\nof the Vterus.\n\n\n\nNote, That this Water doth not help all\nparts, cure all these Infirmities, after one and\nthe same manner, some being reliev'd by consent,\nor by removing Obstructions of other\nparts. It is also used by way of Insession in\nGriefs of the Womb, and by way of Injection\ninto that, as also into the Bowels and Bladder,\nwhere all the Qualities act immediately\nupon those parts; allay the sharp and hot Distempers,\nmitigate the Pains thereof, Healing\nand Corroborating the same.\n\n\nIt may moreover be used by way of Fomentation\nand Losson in external Wounds,\nUlcers, Itch or Scabs, and being drop'd into\nSore Eyes wonderfully cooleth, dryeth and\ncleareth the same.\n\n\nIn a word, If any Intentions in a Medicinal\nway, be to be perform'd by allaying Distempers,\nopening Obstructions, evacuating superfluous\nMorbifick Humours, and Corroborating\nall the parts of the Body, those are\neffected in a very good measure, if not fully\nand perfectly, by this Water.\n\n\nAnd I my self have seen many of the aforenam'd\nDiseases cured by the help thereof;\nand for other Cures effected thereby, I have\nbeen assur'd by them themselves who receiv'd\nthe Benefit, or by others who have been Eyewitnesses\nof the same. Thus far Dr. French.\n\n\nTo the right understanding and due use of\nall which, I shall observe, That the Cure of\nthe Foul Disease can be suppos'd to be put partial;\nunless that Distemper be taken in a less\nstrict Sense; and passing the Notion of Diminishing\nthe Stone, which I had rather express\nby the preventing the increase of its growth,\nI shall for the fixing Experience right, make\nthis Remark, which may be usefully apply'd\nto all the Waters,☞ which is, That\nin some Distempers (as Dropsie, Convulsions,\nJaundies and Gout) constant Success and\nentire Cure is not to be expected, without regard\nto the State of the Disease, the Age and Firmness\nof it, the Cause of it, and the Distempers\ncomplicated with it. Thus a Dropsie may not\nsubmit to this Remedy, not only from the\nFirmness of the Obstruction, but also from the\nConstitution and Laxity of the Patient, from\nthe nature of the Disease, (which I have observ'd\nsometimes to be from a Weakness of\nthe Membranes, by Flatulent Matter contain'd\nin them) or from the Disease inducing\nit. Convulsions here have remedy only adequated\nto the Cause, be it a flatulent putrid\nMatter (which usually gives the Distemper the\nDenomination of Worms, from the effect of\nit,) or be it from Melancholy Hypoch. and\nVapours Hysterical: But if seated in the Brain,\nor supervening an Ague, or in a cold Constitution,\nI think here can scarce have a proper Remedy.\nSo the Jaundies I acknowledge have\nbeen often cur'd by these Waters, and some of\nthe Purging ones, when it ow'd its Rise to an\nObstruction of the Catamenia, a Clog of Phlegm,\nor uncocted Chyle, or Melancholy, but I must\nnot allow these, or any Waters, to cure this\nDisease de Essentia. I think this Caution necessary\nto the understanding the proper Use of\nthese and all Waters, which by the help of\nthis may be distinctly known, and is of the\ngreater Importance, since upon many accounts\nEmpirical Use of these, and all other Remedies,\nis found to be of Fatal Consequence.\n               \n\n                  The Virtues of the Atramentous Waters.\n                  THese Waters, though they have the same\nVirtues with other Chalybeat Waters in\nsome degree, and create an Appetite, and wash\nthe Viscera, yet penetrate not so far, open not\nObstructions so well, but are apt to raise a\nHeat in the Blood, disagreeing to the design'd\nEffect, have not that Acidity, nor calm Astringence.\nThese inrich the Blood, and where\nthat is necessary, and Obstructions remote\ndo not contraindicate, may happily be us'd;\nand in the Stone are Competitors with others.\nAgricola concludes these Effects, as in common\nwith other Vitrioline Waters. To cure\nCorroding Ulcers, Ulcers of the Bladder and\nKidneys, in the Mouth, Weakness of the\nNerves, a weak Stomach they help: And\nthey may be used Internally and Externally.\nBut in Gout, Stone, or in Obstruction of the\nGlands, and smaller Vessels, are not to be\nused without Danger or Inconvenience, so not\nin Hypochondriacal Cases. These are valuable\nin proportion, as they are rich of Steel, keep\nit long, and have little bulk of Salt.\n               \n\n                  The Virtues of the Light Chalybeat Waters.\n                  THE Extraordinary Virtue of this sort\nconsists in, that as the Chalybeat Principles\nare in these most clean, so the Spirit\nmost thin, and the Water both light and thin.\nAnd so we have their Virtues not only most\nfull here, but somewhat differing: They invigorate\nthe Blood without Heating, penetrate\nfarther without Inconvenience, Volatilize, Attenuate\nmore, and their Acidity goes off without\nleaving impression behind it preternatural.\nThus as the heavy Waters that contain less\nof the Steel, and whose Acidity is of a more\nfix'd Nature, have a peculiarity of Astringing\nwithout Heating; so this sort are extraordinarily\nqualify'd for opening Obstructions, but\nseem not to have the same power of Astringing\nin an equal degree: And on this account they\ndo not mortifie a Scorbutick, Leprous Humour\nor Itch so well, nor are so powerful to stop\nFluxes of Blood. I think fit to observe these\ndifferent Effects, which being remark'd, I refer\nthe Reader for the reputed Virtues of these\nChalybeats, to the Virtues of the Knaresborow\nWater. I shall therefore pass on to examine\nwhat Obstructions they remove, which I shall\ndo, by exhibiting only Histories of my own\nObservation; and from thence further to enlighten\nthe use of them.\n                  Among the Cures of this kind, none is more\nfamiliar than that of the Stone, by removing\nthe Disposition to the Generation of it, and\nrestoring a good habit, as well to the whole\nBody, as to the parts immediately concern'd.\nAnd although this Cure is perform'd by a\ntimely Precipitation of the earthy parts out\nof the Latex and Juyces of the parts, and restoring\ntheir natures; and so is owing to the\nQualities that these Chalybeat Waters seem\nto enjoy in common; yet the fineness and\npenetration of this sort of them, must be allow'd\nan extraordinary Qualification.\nBut the Obstructions that I principally intend\nhere, are such as yield to no other Remedy,\nso constantly at least; and whose fatal\nConsequence gives these Waters an inestimable\nvalue. Of this sort, I reckon first an Obstruction\nof the Glands of the Mesentery;\nwherein, beside the sign of Chylous Excrements,\nand rejection of Food an hour or two\nafter eating, the Patient complains not of\nwant of Appetite, discernable Feaver, or pain,\nor other disorder, till Feaver, Cough, and\nwant of Rest (which last often precedes) proceed\nwith the Emaciation upon the continuance\nof this Disease. Of this I have found\nTunbridge Water an effectual Remedy, and\nmost canstant, never failing those that I have\nknown to have try'd it, who have been not a\nfew. And the small Spring at Felstead, I find\navail with equal success.\n                  An Obstruction of the Thymus, which discovers\nit self by pain at the Breast, chiefly\nupon the Foods arrival at the place of its\nseat; which upon the increase of the Tumour\nof this Gland, resists the passing of the Food\ninto the Stomach, and makes the Patient reject\nit, at least as soon as the Oesophagus is a\nlittle fill'd, is a Disease of equal consequence\nwith the other, and which I have known these\nWaters speedily cure.\nAnother Disease from Glandular Obstructions\ncured by these Waters, is the Dropsie, a\nCure of which is taken notice of by Mr. Boyle;\nbut the Design of these Observations, being to\nform an Experience, that may be distinct,\nclear, and not fallacious, I must add, That\nthe Effects of the Waters in this Distemper,\nfall not under so single a consideration as in the\nother, but that there are so many requisites\nin the Cases where these are proper, as make\na good Judgment necessary in the use of them,\nand \n•\norbid the drinking of them without\ngood Advice. For although I have reason to\nbelieve them to be constantly effectual, timely\ntaken, by those whose Constitution was broken\nby trouble, and perhaps to be the only\nRemedy; and likewise in a Phlegmatick Constitution;\nyet not only the seasonable and\ntimely taking of them is to be consulted, but\na Crasis of Blood, that needs not invigorating,\ndoes sometimes receive damage by them. And\nthis I speak not by rote, but have known some\nQuin Faeminae quinquagenariae, florid and lively,\nthat the drinking of these Waters have affected\nwith a beginning Dropsie, the nature\nof these Waters (being to invigorate the\nBlood, and produce the Catamenia) was so differing\nin effect. And in a Dropsie that proceeds\nupon an Asthma, in a person of a florid\nsanguine Complexion, either a Chalybeat Water\nof greater astringency, as the Knaresborow,\nand that has least Steel; or else a Chalybeat\nthat Purges, as Scarborow Water, is much more\nproper.\n                  I proceed to remark next, the like extraordinary\neffect of these light Waters in Distempers\nof the Stomach, the pain by which they\ndiscover themselves is most exquisite. A painful\nTumour of many Months at the pit of the\nStomach, and reputed Scirrhous, I knew reliev'd\nand quite remov'd by Tunbridge Waters.\nI might instance in other Flatulent Distentions\nof the Stomach, and question not but they\nmight be used with success in Ulcers of the\nStomach, though in them I have not known\nthese Waters made tryal of. But the most\ncommon Distemper, or rather Symptom of\nthe Stomach diseased, is known only by the\nname of Pain. It is necessary to distinguish\nthe kinds of this more nicely than is usual,\nand I shall not inquire here into the particular\nseats of it, but mind the Reader in general,\nthat by the name of this Distemper, I understand\nan affection of the Stomach or Ventricle,\nfrom Matter lodg'd in or near it, excepting\nthose Affections of it, per consensum, from the\nHead, or in acute Diseases; and so it includes\nthe primary Distempers of that Region, that\nproduce pain in the Ventricle. I fansie a Syllabus\nof all the Affections and Symptoms of this\nkind, would be useful, and might be instituted\nafter this manner.\n                  Though the pit of the Stomach has the\ngreatest sense of the Pain, yet this Pain may\nbe all over the Stomach.\nSo an obtuse Pain with Faintness and Sickness,\nand an Hemicrania, signifies a watry vapid\nstate of the Blood, as in a Chlorosis.\n\nThe same with Sickness attends a full\nDropsie.\nA rending Pain with weakness, follows great\nEvacuations in weakly Bodies, as Suckling.\nShooting to the Back, denote the matter to\nbe windy, be it in the Cavity or elsewhere,\nand Cholicks vary. To say nothing here of\nUlcers.\nMoving a Rheumatism there fix'd, and increases\nimmediately upon eating.\nPain moving and fixing in Spots, with most\nexquisite Pain, Coldness, and Convulsive Nippings,\nand working off with a Loosness, and\ncoming some six or seven hours after, eating\na nervous Rheumatism, or rather Membranous.\n                  This last again increases or assaults upon\nCold taking, and is sometimes seated in the\nCoats of the Stomach, and sometimes in the\nMembranes adjoyning, or both; so in some\nI have observ'd it to strike from the Stomach\nin a Vein, as they call it, upward, side-ways, or\nthe like; and not to bear a Position of the\nBody that pents it, for the part afflicted always\nseems pent.\nAn obtuse Pain contracting the Stomach,\nsuch as is usually express'd by knitting, attends\nHysterick Fits.\nAn obtuse Pain without this, an Obstruction\nof the Catamenia; or a Plethora sanguinis in\nhot Weather chiefly.\nThe Ventricle may be affected near its upper\nOrifice at the Pit of the Stomach only,\nwith a nipping Pain, or a knitting Pain, attending\nthe Hypochondriacal; and an obtuse\nPain, with a Sense of weight in Trouble and\nMelancholly.\nThe sense of Pentness accompanies Wind,\nthe sense of Fullness, Water or Humour. So\nI might proceed to Soreness, Coldness and\nAcuteness, Faintness, &c.\n\nThere are other Pains near the Stomach,\nas in the Jaundies, about the bottom toward\nthe right side, so in a distemper'd Spleen or\nLiver, or Pancreas, may be known by their\nSituation.\n\nThus Judgment is to be made of the proper\nuse of these Waters, from the Cause or Nature\nof the Disease; and of what means may\nreasonably be used together with them. For\nan Obstruction of the Catamenia may make\nthat Remedy necessary that a Plethora forbids.\nA Chlorosis in a Phlegmatick Constitution is\nbetter cured with other Chaiybeats, and a Pain\nfrom Weakness requires another Intention.\nSo that the use of these Waters is to be confin'd\nchiefly to Pains Convulsive in the Melancholy\nand Hypochondriacal, and to other\nCollections of Wind or Phlegm from any\nObstructions. And although these chiefly\narise from the Affectio Hypochondriaca; and so\nare curable in the general Intention, yet\ngreater Accuracy is necessary both to the Discovery\nof the Distemper, and assigning a Remedy,\nand without which, sure Observation\ncan never be made.\n                  Another Disorder of the Stomach, is want\nor loss of Appetite, which though it is restor'd\nby other Waters and means, yet not\nonly is more fully recover'd by these, but its\ncause more perfectly remov'd.\nBut there are other Distempers cur'd by\nthese Waters, which are less understood, and\nover which these reign alone. I shall instance\nin two. The one is a Fistula, which though\nof many Years standing, I have known effectually\ncur'd in six Weeks, by the sole drinking\nof Tunbridge Water. The other which\nappear'd to me as extraordinary, was a Periodical\nFeaver and Cough, which I knew a Gentlewoman\ncur'd of by the same Waters, who\nfor many Years had never escaped an Assault\nabout October, before she was freed by this\nRemedy. Obstructions of the Pancreas I should\nhave named before.\n                  The Virtue these have of Chearing the Spirits,\nand relieving a Heart oppress'd with\nTrouble, or tumultuated with any Passions, is\nas extraordinary as any of the former; as being\nindeed the Cause and Producer of the\nGlandular Obstructions, which together with\nCephalick Distempers, as Giddiness, Pain, &c.\ncome under the Affectio Hypochondriaca, which\ntherefore I shall consider now distinctly in all\nits Symptoms.\n\n\n                  The Affectio Hypochondriaca,\n                  HAS very numerous Symptoms, and counterfeits\nall Distempers, and upon continuance\nbrings almost as many. I shall consider\nthe Symptoms, and then the reason of\nthem, or seat of it. The Signs enumerated\nby Authors are, a Flatulent Stomach, ill Appetite\nand Concoction, Vomiting glewy petuitose\nMatter, the Stomach Flatulent, not\nwell after Food; upon which came a rejection\nof Food by Vomiting; Lipothymia, Giddiness,\nturbulent Flatus's and Cramps, Convulsions,\nTremors, Ructus's: Aquositates & Flatus inter\nbinas tunicas seu membranos mesenterii; Ventriculi\ndolores vehementes adsunt, qui nonnullis ad\ndorsum usque procedant, & ab aegris incautisque\npro Nephriticis hab\n•\nantur; concoctis cibis quiescunt,\nmox aliis ingestis cibis eodem modo revertuntur,\nqui interdum jejunos, interdum etiam à caenâ\nmolestant; & non cessant priusquam aegri evomunt\ncibos crudos & Phlegmata subamara & caleda aut\nacida; Alvus adstricta; Aestus in Hypochondriis;\nVrinatenuis; Anxietas Ventriculi; Pulsus varii;\nCordis palpitatio; Animi deliquium; Pulsatio in\nsinistro Hypochondrio ab intemperie calidâ; Palatum\nlingua & os exsiccantur; & sitis levis excitatur;\nrespiratio difficilis; dolor quidam & constrictio\nin pectore persentitur. Transit quandoque\nin Melancholiam & Epilepsiam, aut Apoplexiam\nabit; quandoque caeci evadunt; Symptomata Paralysi\n& Convulsioni similia; Lassitudo; Cerebrum\nexsiccant vapores & vigiliae adsunt; Insomnia or\nvain frightful and Distracting Dreams suddenly\nand often disturbing the Sleep. Nightmare,\nor sense of oppressing weight; Tension\nof the Hypochondries, but that is a sign, nor\nconstant, nor peculiar to their Distemper;\nObstruction of the Oesophagu\n•\n\n or Swallow;\nPericulum suffocationis conqueru\n••\ntir; dolor in anteriore\nparte Pectoris; stupor & dolor Formicans\nnunc in dextro nunc in sinistro; Caligo; Dolor in\nBrachio vel digito hoc vel illo; sudor Frigidus,\n& de graviori morbo sibi metuunt. And at last\nthe part where the Humour lodges has its\nSymptoms, as Stomach, Spleen, Liver, &c.\nwhich are then affected most six or seven hours\nafter eating. Whence these Flatus's proceed,\nthe Sense of Sennertus is, Magis consentaneum\nest istos Flatus contineri in illâ cavitate in sinistro\nHypochondrio sub Diaphragmate ex Ventriculi,\nOmenti, Coli & viscerum connexu ortâ, & exitum\nnon habente, sed ita conclusâ ut aquam & Flatus\ncontinere possit. And for the beating in the left\nHypochondry, says he, Ad quam rem faciunt\nGlandulae in Mesenterio plurimae & praecipue magna\nilla, quae in centro ejus primae vasorum distributioni\naddita est. But the more difficult part\nof this Distemper to understand, is, that it\nnot only affects and distempers the Brain, but\nlikewise the Mind it self is a sufferer in it;\nwhich it chiefly or first afflicts with Fear and\nDespair; and freeing the Passions from the\ngovernment of Reason, makes way to all the\nextravagant Actings, that an abused Imagination\ncan give colour to; and every Object\nreceives its weight from the Standard of the\nruling Passion. The extravagant Dotages of\nthis kind are numerous in History, and either\nare ruled by the Impressions of the last Stage,\nor Age of Life, or drown us in the present;\nor which is most common, distract between\nthe Sense of both; and make us lose the use\nof our Judgment, if not of our Reason. Now\nthis Distemper is effectually cured in all its\nSymptoms, by these Light Chalybeat Waters,\nand to inquire into the Nature of this Distemper,\nand on what account they do it,\nmay not only be agreeable to enlighten the\nDisease, but teach us the full Scope of the\nVirtue of the Remedy. If we seek into the\nCause and Seat of this Distemper, we may\nobserve it to be induced by despiriting, and\nmay have its Original either in the Mind, or\nthe Body; and as it naturally is produced in\nour Bodies, I observe,\n                  1. That it is a Flatus, as gross, crude, unconcocted,\nand vapid.\n2. That the Fit usually comes six hours after\neating, or as soon as the Chyle is digested, and\nthe Spirit of it spent.\n3. It is occasion'd by Diet, yielding a thick\nand plentiful Nourishment, and Flatulent, and\nby thick fermented Liquors as Ale.\n4. A working active Life that preserves the\nConcoction, and duly forceth on the Nourishment,\nand cleanseth the Body, joyn'd with a\nspare and more simple Diet, is little affected\nwith this Distemper.\n5. Sower Belchings, not Signs of Acid in\nthe Body, as is commonly judg'd erroniously,\nbut only the effect of rich Liquors despirited,\nand effete or changed.\n6. The time of its Accession is remarkable,\nwhich is at the Turn of Life to its declive, or\nat 27 Years, though may be put off longer in\nsome, but begins then, when the Body begins\nto be despirited, when whereas before we see\nevery thing through the eyes of hope, we now\nare apt to view with despair.\n                  7. It joyns hand with the Scurvy.\n8. Is cured by Acids, as Spirit of Vitriol or\nSulphur in some measure, and kept off by\ndrinking common Water, which is void of\nFermentation, or elastick Turgescence.\nAll which marks inform us, That this Distemper\nis seated in the Chyle, which when\neffete and tumultuating, produceth these effects;\nand as it may be discharg'd and slung, may induce\nmore terrible ones in earnest, which as\nit is moving, it only represents by lighter\ntouches: And as the grand Cardo of our Life\nat the Climocteric before named, gives opportunity\nfor this Insult; so the strength of\nthese Turgid parts of our Nourishment, is\ndiscernable in other States of Life, though the\nViolence is most apparent at the meeting of\ndiffering habits. For that all these Irregularities\nare owing to our Nourishment, and that\nwe admit our Dispositions to Passion and Vice\nby our Throat, and only then when we take\nmore than is necessary or requir'd by Nature,\nwe are taught not only in Men where we see\nthe effects of Ease and Luxury, only when it\nis in an high degree; but the power of differing\nNourishment and manner of living, is\nmost conspicuous in other Animals, especially\nthe more tender. These Animals that live\nhard (that is) use great labour to get their\nFood; and that mild and unfermented, are\nfree from three Dispositions that Domestick\nAnimals, as those that dwell near Towns, or\nhave opportunity of living easie, are lyable\nto. The first is, change of colour in Coat or\nFeathers. 2. Inconstancy to their Mate, and\nIntemperance in Passions. The last is, Distemperature\nof Body, and lyableness to Diseases.\nNo wild Animal was ever observ'd by\nNaturalists, to have been seiz'd by those Diseases\nwhich afflict them when kept \n•\ntame.\nHens I have seen Epileptic, Magpyes are often\nafflicted by the same Distemper when housed,\nbut who ever found them fallen in the Fields?\nThe same may be observ'd of other Animals,\nas Bull-finches, and many Quadrupids, which\ncan scarce bear housing, without peril of\nsome Disease or other. Which seems to imply,\nthat a distemper'd Air can make no impression,\nbut upon a vitiated Nourishment.\nAnd this gives me a rise to add, That as the\nEfforts of our Passions, that are owing to our\nIntemperance, are more silent in other seasons\nof our Life, so it is observable, they\nhave not been distinguish'd by any Inquirers\ninto Humane Nature, through want of well\nunderstanding Humane Nature distinctly, or\nin its simplicity. And here I find a late excellent\nAuthor much wanting to himself, in\nnot examining the Fountains of Idea's, which\nwould have helped him to have uncompounded\nthem, who, might by this means have discern'd\nPractical Idea's; a Principle of Justice\nbeing as difficultly erased, as that of Self-preservation.\nFor (to wave questioning the\nHypothesis of Idea's) since Judgment is made\nof Objects, as they lye in the Imagination, it\nmust needs be, that, as on the one hand the\nundue Examination of things may make a Notion\nimperfect, so the strain of Imagination\nby our Passions, must render our Judgment unjust.\nAnd this we see in our grosser Passions,\nas Fear, Anger, Love or Aversion, but cannot\ndiscern it so well in the lesser Emotions of our\nTemper, which seem more quiet, wherein yet\nit is equally discoverable, that the Inequality\nof our Temper sways our Judgment, and is\noften before-hand in the Cause, where it appears\nonly in the sequel, and seems to proceed\nfrom the Determination. Indeed we\nmay usually see in any error the stamp of\nthat Temper that form'd the Argument, or\nof a rapid and unheedy Apprehension, that\ninform'd the Understanding; so necessary to\nright thinking and due Notions of things is\na due Temper, by how much our Passions\nhave a share in adjusting, if not forming, our\nIdea's. I might here observe the Mistake of\nthose that refer the illness of their Nature,\nto the necessity of their make, and how natural\nthe Account is, of Man's first Defection:\nBut to keep close to my Subject, I shall only\nmind, that the Debility of our Mind, as well\nas the Infirmities of our Bodies, is owing to\nthe Irregularity of our Living, and Vice of\nour Nourishment. An Instance of this, is the\nDistemper in hand, not only in the distracting\nFears, and tumultuating Passions, that\nattend it; and the innumerable delirous Fancies\nthat are consequent to it, but in the Diseases\nof the Body, as Obstructions of the parts\nbefore mention'd, with Cephalick Diseases,\nas Convulsions, Epilepises, Apoplexies, &c.\nthe last nam'd of which, is so often owing to\nthe Pre-disposition of this Distemper, as much\nconfirms the account I have before given of\nit. Now although the reason of the Hypochondriac\nAffection, as it gives a reason of\nthe effect of these Waters, may make this\naccount satisfactory enough; yet it is farther\nserviceable, in discovering the Cure more\nclearly and perfectly, and by giving a right\nNotion of it, may assist in setting the Understanding\nto rights, and help those that are\nafflicted, to make a true Judgment of their\nDisturbances, as well as incourage them to a\nCure. With respect to a Cure, we may observe\nthe Benefit of Exercise, and a moderate\nDiet, without fermented Liquors; and that\nAction and Attention are required, to Health\nof Body and Mind. That Action is necessary\nto due Thinking, all studious Men may and\ndo observe, and the reason is, That the Tumults\nof the Chyle, or Stoppages of the Vessels\nby it, are remov'd by the hurry of the\nBlood; which, together with steadiness of\nMind, which I call Attention, gives our Engine\nits free Exercise and Working. And as\nthe same thing, that Exercise doth with moderate\nLiving, is effected artificially by these\nWaters, so the pleasure of an even Life, void\nof these Hurries and Inconveniencies, recommend\na preventional Method of this way of\nLiving, for its Rectitude and Generosity, before\nthe Flights and Extreams of the other,\nthat must seek for Remedies to Art. And it\nis to be noted, That as this Distemper, in all\nits Symptoms and Consequences, is effectually\ncured by these Waters; and as it is moderated\nby the foremention'd means, so all that are\naffected with it, find their Error in drinking\nWine and strong fermented Liquors, as an\nartificial Support, by the great sinking of\ntheir Spirits, if not other Symptoms; likewise\nabout six hours after, and by the increase\nof the Distemper by that means. To which\nI may add, what may be no small Information,\nand hath not been taken notice of by\nPhysicians usually, That the Distempers that\nseize the Body at the Climactericks, if they\nbe moderated, so as to be kept from making\nany mortal breach, will usually in two or\nthree Years time, depart of themselves upon\nmoderate living. I could give many Instances\nof Epilepsies themselves, as well as Giddinesses,\nConvulsions, a beginning Phthisis, &c. that\nabated without any means two or three Years\nafter. But as this Remedy, viz. these Waters,\nrelieve variety of Diseases, that are induced\nby the power of distemper'd Chyle or\nNourishment, and Weakness of Constitution\nat the Cardines of our Life or Climactericks;\nso the Observation of this may turn to account,\nif we consider, That many Distempers\nthat are not usually distinguish'd, are of this\nOriginal: For the enlarging therefore of this\nBenefit, we may observe, That the Affectio\nHypochondriaca, is, in this respect, but a Species\nof Distempers, which we may call Climacteric\nor Cardinal. For the better understanding\nof my Sense in this matter, I must\ntake notice, That though I cannot admit the\nreceiv'd Notion of them fully, either as to\ntheir Fatality, or superstitious Original from\nNumbers, yet that at the Septenaries, or near\nthe Body, receives its Changes, is not to be\ndenied; and that then many Diseases have\ntheir Original, which may execute not fully\ntill some Years after. But although every\nSeptenary may be in some sort considerable,\nyet I judge from Experience, that some may\nbe reputed Cardinal, and that not from the\nEfficacy of Number, which runs the grand\nClimacteric upon 63. Those that I find reason\nto name Cardinal, are those on which our\nLife receives a considerable Change of State;\nand though the fourteenth Year, on this account,\ncannot be excluded, yet Observation\nof Distempers, or Mortality, makes me, with\nrespect to Diseases, to make or name three\ngrand Climactericks, and to fix them on those\nYears, when the Body receives its grand Alterations\nin its Cuspis and declension, and\nthese are 21, 27 and 49. The Diseases of the\nfirst are Hemorrhages and Consumptions,\nwhich are frequent at that Age to enter the\nConstitution, and not to yield to Remedies\ntill two or three Years after, though the Prevention\nof Exulceration render it curable.\nThe Distempers of the second are Cephalick,\nNervous and Flatulent. Those of the third\nagain are Phthises, Gouts, Stone, Hemorhagies,\nRheumatisms, and other Inflammations,\nthat proceed from an over Alkalisat\nCrasis of the Blood, as hot, burning or smarting\nrunning Pains, and the like. In all which\ncases these Waters may be expected to be\nhighly serviceable, by the same Qualifications\nthat capacitate them to relieve the Hypochondriacal,\nviz. by Astringing, Deobstructing,\nInvigorating, and taking off either the Orgasm\nor Degeneracy of the Chyle. And I\nspeak not this without some Instances that favour\nit: But from Hypochondriacal Distempers,\nI pass on next to Ulceration of the Kidneys,\nwhich I have known cured in more than\none by Tunbridge Waters, which I must make\nthis Remark on, That they were Women of\nthe last cardinal or grand Climacterick. But\nyet must not this confine the use of these Waters\nto that case only, or forbid their proper\nuse in like Ulcers in other Ages.\n                  \nThus according to my design, I have recited\nwhat I have experienced of their Virtues, but\nI must not pass the Cure of Periodical annual\nColds and Feavers (which I mention above)\nwithout this useful Observation, that as it is\nthe Peccancy of the Chyle, or Faeces of it,\nthat makes the Body obnoxious to the Effects\nof the Air, so it may be reasonable to expect\nthe use of the same Remedy to be successful in\nsome other Distempers that come under this\nConsideration.\n               \n\n                  Of some general Directions to be observ'd in\nthe Vse of the Chalybeat Waters.\n                  THE Directions that emerge from the Nature\nof the Waters, and of the Distempers\nthey are used in, vary in some measure\nwith the Constitution of the Drinker, the\nState and Nature of the Distemper, and Season\nthey are drank in. And although the\nChoice of the Species of Water is directed by\nthe Distemper, yet nice or infirm and cold\nConstitutions, make exactness necessary in\nchoosing those that have least Coldness; on\nwhich account some have found, in the light\nsort, Wellenborow and Islington less safe to be\ndrank, or to require more caution, from their\nill Effects on those that have drank them when\nout of Temper. The Season that one would\nwish to drink these Waters in, is a dry Time,\nand Summer, the Waters being then strongest,\nand the Season favouring their exerting\ntheir Astringency, and inspiriting Qualities;\nyet as Distempers do not wait always for the\nconveniency of the Remedy, so the Waters\nhave been found effectual at all Seasons likewise.\nAnd the incommode of the Season\nmay be help'd, by a Glass of somewhat more\nGenerous, after the Waters are run off, as\nGentian Wine, or the like; or Chalybeat Wine\nin the Afternoon, which I have \n•\nound to be\nvery Helpful, where the Moisture of the Season,\nor Weakness of the Constitution made it\nnecessary; but not to be continued longer\nthan it was so. The difference of the Water\nmakes some difference in the rule of Drinking,\nthe Heavy ones not allowing so long a Continuation\nof Drinking, and often admitting,\nif not requiring, Purging, during the Course,\nwhich six Weeks may well determine; whereas\nthe light sort may safely, and ought to be\ncontinued longer, to prevent return of the\nDisease, and establish the Constitution: Else\nthe Chalybeat Waters require the same common\nRule, which is to be observ'd before, in\nthe time of, and after the drinking. Before\nthe drinking, that the foulness of the first\nways may not be carried farther, and at least\nclog the Remedy, and that Nature may be\nmore light and easie, that must be removed,\nbefore the drinking of the Waters is entred\nupon. And although it cannot be supposed,\nthat the proper Purges for particular cases,\ncan here be consulted, yet that Emeticks, in\nCephalick Diseases, are best and fittest to answer\nall the ends necessary, is an Intimation\nI cannot allow my self to pass. Catharticks\nought to be doubled at about two days distance,\nthe first to regard the cleansing the\nfirst ways, may be by a Bole of Lenitive Electuary,\nand as much Resina Jallopii as may\nquicken it to desire, or Pills, or Draughts of\nInfusion of Sena and Rhubarb; in both which\nforms, I admire the additions of Salts either\nof Wormwood or Tartar, that may make\nthem more detersive, and occur any unnatural\nor exorbitant Acid. The latter Purgation\nought to regard the Disease, as Lenitive Electuary\nwith P. Diasenae, and Dialtheae, or\nManna for Gravel. In Colicks, and where\nthe Wind afflicts the Bowels, Hiera Picra.\nIn Cephalick Distempers, or where there is a\nDisposition to be Aguish, gentle Emeticks.\nWhere Wind afflicts the more remote Passages,\nor in the Blood, afflicting the Muscular parts,\nInfusions of Purging Ingredients, as Sena and\nRhubarb, with a handful of Chamomel Flowers,\nor the Weakness of the Stomach may require\nthe Decotum amarum made Purging, or\nPills of Rudii and Ruffii mix'd, and two or\nthree drops of Oyl of Cinnamon. The Dropsical\nSuccus Ebuli in the quantity of Cochl. 2\nvel 3 is most proper for, in my Judgment: In\nthe Melancholick Constitutions, an Infusion\nof Sena and Salt of Tartar, among others, is\none of the first rate: The Scurvy, bitter Decoctions.\nThe three last Diseases, these Waters,\nas other Chalybeats, serve, by strengthning,\ninvigorating, and carrying off the offending\nMatter; and therefore those need a\ndue preparatory Course, as is sufficient to\nbring the Blood and Vessels into such a state\nas may be fit for these Waters. But yet beginning\nDropsies, and other Obstructions from\nTrouble of Mind, admit these Waters as the\nonly Remedy, and require no course but this\ngeneral Preparation. Excepting Dropsies, and\nDistempers that are attended with old Obstructions,\nand Apoplectick Dispositions in Phlegmatick\nBrains, I say, setting aside these, the\nPurging Waters are the best Preparative, washing\nmore universally, and leaving the Body in\nthe Temper that is most fit; and sometimes\nprevents the necessity of these Chalybeat Waters;\nthe Proprieties of which, will appear in\na Table at the end of their History. But because\nPains of the Stomach often happen to\nbe so violent, as not to allow the use of these\nWaters▪ before they are abated, and sometimes\nrequire a particular Evacuation, it seems\nincumbent on me, to give some information,\nhow that Symptom may be reliev'd: They\nare usually one of these three sorts, First, a\nConvulsive Nipping Pain at the pit of the\nStomach, that holds for some Weeks, and soon\nupon eating is exacerbated: This usually readily\ngives way, either to an Infusion of Baccae\nJuniperi in Whitewine, or Ol. Terebinth taken\ninwardly, the last 16 drops at a time in\nBeer. Another is a Pain all over the Stomach,\nthough sometimes gathering more to one part\nof it, and is more violent and racking, and\ngoes off with a Looseness, being from a Congestion\nof Watry Matter; This yields to the\ncommon Domestick Glysters often repeated,\nand is check'd by Ens Veneris, and sometimes\nby Chalybeat Wine. The Pain that attends\na Chlorosis by Ol. Caryophyllorum taken in Sugar;\nif from a depauperate Blood, by Vinum Chalybeatum.\n\nPhlebotomy here comes under consideration,\nwhich, although some Asthma's, and other\ncases, may render it necessary, yet, where\nnot necessary, is to be avoided, as an ill Prepara\n•\nivee\nfor drinking of Water; and must be\nreferr'd, together with other Preparations in\npartic\n•••\n Distempers, to the Judgment of\nthe Physician that knows the Distemper, and\nconsults the Constitution.\nOf drinking I purpose not to prescribe\neither time or quantity, which vary with the\nDisease and Constitution of the Drinker; but\nonly shall note, that as rising gradually▪ to a\nfull quantity, is required not only by the body,\nthat it may the better bear it, but by the distemper'd\npart too: So the Vessels, that they\nmay be cleansed and strengthned in their own\nTone and Tension, require a gradual decrease.\nBut though the continuation of this Remedy\nmust be prescrib'd by the Nature of the Disease,\nyet that a Caution is necessary, that the\ndrinking them be not left off too soon, appears\nin that in my own Observation, many\nhaving suffer'd a Relapse, for want of continuing\nthe Remedy some time after the Cure.\nAnd this is so general, that I may peremptorily\nassert, that less than three Months is not\ngenerally sufficient to the drinking of them,\nthough they take effect in half the time. It is\nnot convenient to drink these Waters too\nearly, nor without some preceding walking\nto empty the Body; neither is it safe to lye\ndown upon them, especially in Cephalick Distempers;\nnor to allow any business to take\nplace in the Thoughts; on which score the\ndistance of the Wells, and the Resort, recommends\nthe drinking these Waters at their\nSprings. But the most material Rule, which\nthe very design of them require, is, That during\nthe Course, the Drinker use Exercise,\navoid all Flatulent Diet, and that of Gross\nand much Nourishment, and drink as little\nfermented Liquor as he may. And here especially\ndrinking much Wine is to be condemned\non a double account, for beside that the inconvenient\nTemper that the Wine gives, renders\nthem unfit for drinking the Waters the\nMorning following, it opposes the Remedy,\nand renders it ineffectual, by supporting the\nMorbid State; and for this Reason, as generous\nLiquors are not to be omitted at the beginning\nof the drinking, so they ought wholly\nto be set aside when the Course is well enter'd;\nwithout which, Hypochondriacism, which is\nthe most general Case, will not admit of any\nentire Conquest. Neither is the Course of\nLiving to be ended with the Course of drinking\nthe Waters, but that the use of them\nmay be effectual; a spare Diet, and the same\nabstemious living, with Exercise, ought to be\ncontinued for two Months, in which time the\nBody may be suppos'd to be a little confirm'd.\nAnd for the same Reason, though some Distempers,\nas Stone, Jaundies, and Melancholy,\nparticularly, may require some other Intentions\nto be satisfied, and so make a Course of\nPhysick necessary at the same time, yet the\nuse \n〈◊〉\n the Waters is so much the less beneficial,\nby how much it is disturb'd by Purging,\nor any other Medicines, and therefore Reason\nand Experience place this means last. But in\nApoplexies, and some watry Distempers, as\nDropsie and Chlorosis, an Astringent more potent\nis very necessary to close and strengthen\nthe Parts. The most proper and powerful of\nthis kind. I intimated above, to be the Ens\nVeneris of Mr. Boyle, which, if it succeed, the\nWaters, as the other Detersives and Purgers,\nare to precede, make an entire Course in the\nsurprizing Distemper that I there apply it to;\nand in the room of it, I have sometimes used\nChalybs Preparat. with equal Success, if the\nApoplectick Symptoms were mild.\n                  These Waters, as they suffer by warming,\nso are apt to bring some Disorders, especially\nin an ill Season or Constitution, as Cold, Nauseousness,\ndifficulty of Urine and Giddiness,\nwhich are usually provided against by drinking\na Glass of Wine after every three or four\nGlasses of Water, for the first few Mornings.\nBut because the two last Symptoms do sometimes\nprove more considerably obstinate, I\nshall take notice, that it is good for those\nthat are obnoxious to Cephalick Diseases, to\nprovide against the Giddiness procur'd by\nthese Waters, by chewing of Nutmeg, and indeed\nBisket, or a Crust of Bread chew'd do\nthe same, the motion of the Jaws seeming as\nnecessary as the warming the Stomach. And\nfor the Stoppage of Urine, shall acquaint the\nDrinker, that where it is not occasion'd by\nthe Stone, though Glysters and Purgers may\nbe requir'd sometimes, yet it may soon be remov'd\nwithout usually, only Ol. Terebinth.\nguttis iij. in umbilicum instillatis: And the same\nI have known done by a plentiful Glass of\nRhenish. But in all these Rules, I must make\nthis reserve for the Heavy Chalybeat Waters,\nThat Purging is absolutely necessary during\nthe taking of those, which are not so clean,\nnor pass so well, and may bind the Body too\nmuch.\n\nI have nothing more to add, but for a Conservative\nof Health, to recommend the drinking\nof Tunbridge Waters with Wine in Winter,\nto the Hypochondriacal, which are easier\nto be had than the German Spaw, and are as\nmuch better than those, by how much they\nare lighter, and which, in Flasks headed with\nOyl, will keep well.\n               \n\n", "image_url": "A23627/00023.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

Half the Coeficient is 652.28979, its square is 425481.9701382441, to which add the absolute Number 91415.43548, the Sum is 516897.4056182441, whose square Root is 718.95, which added to the half Coeficient makes 1371.24 the desired =Z.

In Fig. Z, If RC be made equal to DE in Fig. Y, and CD in Fig. Z, be made equal to the double of the greatest Range, then CA will be a mean Proportion. Further in Fig. Y, if AC be Radius, and CB the Sine of the Angle of Elevation, and AD be made equal to the greatest Range in the Parabola, then DE will be a fourth Proportion. Let DF in Fig. Z, be made equal to DE in Fig. Y, then AL will be the Line desired.\nGP = square of DC, and GrS / R = square of AC, also because the sine of GP is −, and GrS / R is +, therefore the square of AD is the difference of those Squares, 47.

IV.\n               IN the Year 1673. I published my Genuine Use of the Gun, upon the Principles of Galileus without any accidental Impediment, that is, that the Transit of the Bullet to be in the Curve of a Parabola, and from that to Hit a Mark at demand within the reach of the Piece Analitically, as well upon Ascents as Descents, as upon the Plain of the Horizon. In the Year 75, Mons. Blundell in his de jeter les Bombes, pag. 283. propounded that Problem to the Royal Academy of Sciences of France, to be resolved Geometrically, Mons. Buot, Romer the Sweed, and Mons. de la Hire set upon the Mathematical Part, from Page 285. to Page 312. of the said de jeter les Bombes; whilst Mons. Marriott and Perault made many Experiments several times repeated before the Royal Academy, Mons. the Dauphin being present,\nviz. with Water, with a Bow, with a Cross-Bow, a Stone-Bow, an Engin in imitation of the ancient Balistes, with a Pistol, and with Quicksilver, all agreeing precisely with that of Galileus de jeter les Bombes, pag. 490. For which Service the French King made Mons. Blondell Master de Camp and gave him about 200l. sterl. a Year, as I am credibly informed. Whilst the French Mathematicians and Philosophers were a trying the Truth of this noble Invention of the famous Galileus, for the carrying on of their Warlike Designs; here in England some Persons made Experiments upon Black-Heath, and near Newington-Butts, but what they amounted to I know not.\n               By these means the French Engineers sling their Shot as exactly as the Benjamites, and ours in England remain as at first.\nBut as I have been at some Pains and Charge to bring the Use of Great Artillery to a greater perfection than formerly, in my Genuine Use of the Gun, and in a Treatise To Hit a Mark, so now, I move forward, that ingenious Persons may be instructed in that Art, so they may be capable to serve, and to be an Honour to their King and Country.\n\n                  In order to which: For the Improvement and Practice of the MORTAR.\n                  LET there be a firm Platform, and a Mortar-piece about 6 Inches diameter, with a fit Ball, mounted in a Carriage to move from an Horizontal to a Vertical Line, and to be firmly fixt to any degree and Minute at demand, and even ground for two Mile in length; such a Platform, Mortar-piece, and level Ground, is fit for extraordinary Service, and to instruct the Gunners, that so they may see\nand understand the Ranges of their Piece, and learn to strike any Mark at demand within the reach of the said Piece.\n                  The Gunners to be instructed one day in a Week throughout the Year, and upon publick days to shoot for a Piece of Plate given by the King, tho to the value of 5 s. in doing which, His Majesty will be no Loser if Wars continue.\n\n\n                  For the Improvement and Practice of LONG-GUNS.\n                  LET there be a firm Platform to mount the Guns upon, and 2 or 3 Mile of Ground to Range the Shot, and a moveable Butt to be set up perpendicular to the Horizon, the Gunners to be practised one day in a Week, and to shoot for a Piece of Plate on general days; such a Method will make them expert Gunners, and that Prince that will not use some such Method to exercise his Gunners, will lose a great deal more than that Charge comes to when he puts them to Service.\nIf any make Objections, and say, That the Gunners cannot practice that of the Parabola.\n\n                     To which I Answer.\n                     I'll take a Gunner of the Capacity of a Youth of 14 years of Age, and teach him Arithmetick, and so much of Geometry that is requisite for Practice, and learn him the Use of the Mortar, that he shall be capable to strike any Mark at demand within the reach of the Piece when it is demanded of him, and to teach the rest of the Gunners to do the like.\n\nBut,\n\nIf the Gunners say they can strike any Mark at demand within the reach of the Piece according to that of the Parab.\n\n\n                     Then, To conclude my Endeavours.\n                     Concerning the Improvement of Great Artillery, I freely offer to be at the Charge of Platform, Mortar-piece mounted, Powder, Ball, and all things necessary for extraordinary Service, and a Medal of Silver, if they whom it chiefly concerns will command the Gunners to endeavour to strike a Mark at any place within the reach of the Piece, and he that comes nearest the Mark with the most rational Rules of Art, shall have the Medal of Silver.\n\n\n                     Not to omit the Example of two eminent Soldiers.\n                     When the Lord Fairfax besieged Worcester, he had a Scotch Man for his Engineer; Nathaniel Nye, a very young Man, went to the L. Fairfax, and desired that he and the Scotch Engineer might have a fair Tryal with their Mortar-piece against the Town, and he that did the best Service, should be the L. Fairfax's Engineer; to which the L. Fairfax readily answered, All the reason in the world. The said Nat. Nye blew up the Magazine, which forced them to surrender, for which he was made the L. Fairfax's Engineer, and Master Gunner of Worcester. From an eminent Person now living that was an Eye and Ear Witness.\n\nOliver Cromwell sent for Mr. Wright, a Joyner by Profession, and took care of his Family, sent him to the Siege of Dunkirk, with 2 Eighteen Inch Mortar-pieces, which were so well managed by the said Wright and one Stint, that the first Granado they threw into the Town fell near the Town-House, and made such a prodigious Breach, that the Governur of the Town set up the white Flag immediately, and capitulated.\n\nBut, when unworthy Persons and Relations were preferr'd the Government dwindled to\n\n\n\n\nFINIS.\n", "image_url": "A25368/00003.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

The cauſe of my comming hither is for foure reſpects. Firſt to ſee the bleſſed face of your Maieſty, whoſe wonderfull fame hath reſounded ouer all Europe & the Mahometan Countries. Whē I heard of the fame of your Maieſty, I haſtened hither with ſpeed and trauelled very cherefully to ſee your glorious Court. Secondly, to ſee your Maieſties Elephants, which kind of beaſts I haue not ſeen in any other country. Thirdly, to ſee your famous Riuer Ganges, which is the Captaine of all the Rieuer of the world. The fourth is this, to intreat your Maieſty that you would vouchſafe to grant mee your gracious Paſſe that I may trauell into the Country of Tartaria to the Citty of Samarcand, to viſit the bleſſed Sepulcher of the Lord of the Corners (this is a title that is giuen to Tamberlaine in this Country in that Perſian language, and wheras they call him the Lord of the Corners, by that they meane that he was Lord of the corners of the world, that is, the higheſt and ſupreme Monarch of the Vniuerſe): whoſe fame by reaſon of his warres and victories,\nis publiſhed ouer the whole world: perhaps he is not altogether ſo famous in his own Country of Tartaria, as in England. Moreouer, I haue a great deſire to ſee the bleſſed Toombe of the Lord of the Corners for this cauſe; for that when I was at Conſtantinople, I ſaw a notable old building in a pleaſant garden neer the ſaid City, where the Chriſtian Emperor that was called Emanuell made a ſumptuous great Banquet to the Lord of the Corners, after he had taken Sultan Batazet in a great battell that was fought neere the City of Burſia, where the Lord of the Corners bound Sultan Batazet in fetters of Gold, and put him in a cage of Iron. Theſe 4 cauſes moued me to come out of my natiue Country thus farre, hauing trauelled a foote through Turky and Perſia, ſo farre haue I traced the world into this Country, that my pilgrimage hath accompliſhed three thouſand miles, wherin I haue ſuſtained much labour and toile, the like wherof no mortall man in this World did euer performe to ſee the bleſſed face of your Maieſty ſince the firſt day that you were inaugurated in your glorious Monarchall throne.\n                        \n\n\n\nAfter I had ended my ſpeech, I had ſome ſhort diſcourſe with him in the Perſian tongue who amongſt other things told me, that concerning my trauell to the City of Samarcand, he was not able to doe me any good, becauſe there was no great amity betwixt the Tartarian Princes and himſelfe, ſo that his commendatory letters would doe me no\ngood. Alſo he added, that the Tartars did ſo deadly hate all Chriſtians, that they would certainely kill them when they came into their Country. So that he earneſtly diſwaded me frō the iourny, if I loued my life and welfare; at laſt he concluded his diſcourſe with me by a ſum of mony that he threw downe from a windowe through which he looked out, into a ſheete tied vp by the foure corners, and hanging very neer the ground a hundred peeces of ſiluer, each worth two ſhillings ſterling, which coū\nteruailed ten pounds of our Engliſh mony: this buſines I carried ſo ſecretly by the help of my Perſian, that neither our Engliſh Ambaſſador, nor any other of my Countrimen (ſauing one ſpeciall, priuate, & intrinſical friend) had the leaſt inkling of it, till I had throughly accompliſhed my deſigne: for I well knew that our Ambaſſador▪ would haue ſtopped and Barracadocd all my proceeding therein, if he might haue had any notice thereof, as indeed he ſignified vnto me after I had effected my proiect, aleaging this forſooth for his reaſon why he would haue hindered me, becauſe it would redound ſome what to the diſhonour of our Nation, that one of our Countrey ſhould preſent himſelfe in that beggarly and poore faſhion to the King out of an inſinuating humor to craue mony of him, but I anſwered our Ambaſſador in that ſtout & reſolute manner after I had ended my buſines, that he was contented to ceaſe nibling at me, neuer had I more need of mony in all my life then at that time: for in truth\nI had but twenty ſhillings ſterling left in my purſe by reaſon of a miſchance I had in one of the Turkes Cities called Emert in the country of Meſopotamia, where a miſcreant Turke ſtripped me of almoſt all my monies, according as I wrote vnto you in a very large letter the laſt yeer, which I ſent from the Court of this mighty Monarch by one of my Countrimen that went home by Sea in an Engliſh ſhippe laden with the commodities of this India, which letter I hope came to your hands long ſince. After I had been with the King, I went to a certaine noble & generous Chriſtian of the Armeniā race, 2 daies iourny frō the Mogols court, to the end to obſerue certain remarkable matters in the ſame place, to whom by means of my Perſian tongue I was ſo welcome that hee entertained me with very ciuill and courteous complement, and at my departure gaue mee very bountifully twenty peeces of ſuch kind of mony as the King had done before, coūteruailing 40 ſhillings ſterling. About ten daies after that, I departed frō\nAzmere the court of the Mogol Prince, to the end to begin my Pilgrimage after my long reſt of fourteen moneths back againe into Perſia, at what time our Ambaſſador gaue mee a peece of Gold of this Kings Coine worth foure and twenty ſhillings, which I will ſaue (if it be poſſible) till my ariuall in England: ſo that I haue receiued for beneuolences ſince I came into this country twenty markes ſterling ſauing two ſhillings eight pence, & by the way vppon the confines of Perſia alitle before\nI came into this country three and thirty ſhillings foure pence in Perſian mony of my Lady Sherly: at this preſent I haue in the City of Agra where hence I wrote this letter, about twelue pounds ſterling, which according to my maner of liuing vppon the way at two-pence ſterling a day (for with that proportion I can liue pretty well, ſuch is the cheapnes of all eatable things in Aſia, drinkable things coſting nothing, for ſeldome doe I drinke in my pilgrimage any other liquor then pure water) will mainetaine mee very competently three yeeres in my trauell with meate drinke and clothes. Of theſe gratuities which haue been giuen me willingly, would I ſend you ſome part as a demonſtration of the filiall loue and affection which euery child bred in ciuility and humility ought to performe to his louing and good mother: but the diſtance of ſpace betwixt this place and England, the hazard of mens liues in ſo long a ioureny, and alſo the infidelity of many men, who though they liue to come home, are vnwilling to render an account of the things they haue receiued, doe not a little diſcourage me to ſend any precious token vnto you; but if I liue to come one day to Conſtantinople againe (for thither doe I reſolue to goe once more by the grace of Chriſt, and therehence to take my paſſage by land into Chriſtendom ouer renouned Greece) I wil make choice of ſome ſubſtantial & faithfull Countriman, by whom I will ſend ſome prety token as an expreſſion of my dutifull and obedient\nreſpect vnto you. I haue not had the oppertunity to ſee the King of Perſia as yet ſince I came into this country, but I haue reſolued to goe to him when I come next into his Territories, and to ſearch him out whereſoeuer I can find him in his Kingdome; for ſeeing I can diſcourſe with him in his Perſian tongue, I doubt not but that going vnto him in the forme of a Pilgrime, he will not onely entertaine me with good words, but alſo beſtow ſome worthy reward vpon me beſeeming his dignity and perſon; for which cauſe I am prouided before hand with an excellent thing written in the Perſian tongue that I meane to preſent vnto him: and thus I hope to get beneuolences of worthy perſons to maintaine me in a competent maner in my whole pilgrimage till I come into England, which I hold to be as laudable & a more ſecure courſe then if I did continually carry ſtore of mony about mee. In the letter which I wrote vnto you by an Engliſh ſhip the laſt yeere, I made relation vnto you both of my iourny from the once holy Hieruſalem hither and of the ſtate of this Kings Court, and the Cuſtomes of this Country, therfore I hold it ſuperfluous to repeat the ſame things againe, but what the countryes are, that I meane to ſee betwixt this and Chriſtendome, and how long time I will ſpend in each country, I am vnwilling to aduertiſe you of at this preſent, deſiring rather to ſignify that vnto you after I haue performed my deſigne then before; howbeit in few words, I will tell you of certaine Cities\nof great renown in former times, but now partly ruined, that I reſolue (by Gods help) to ſee in Aſia, where I now am, namely ancient Babilon & Nymrods Tower, ſome few miles from Niniue, & in the ſame the Sepulcher of the Prophet Ionas, ſpacious & goodly; Caire in Egypt, heretofore Memphis, vpō the famous Riuer Nilus, where Moiſes, Aron, & the children of Iſrael liued with king Pharaoh, whoſe ruined Palace is ſhewed there til this day, & a world of other mouable things as memorable as any City of the whole world yeeldeth, ſauing only Ieruſalem: but in none of theſe or any other Cities of note do I determin to linger as I haue done in other places, as in Conſtantinople, and Azmere, in this Eaſterne India, onely ſome few daies will I tarry in a principall city of fame, to obſerue euery principal matter there and ſo be gone. In this City of Agra where I am now, I am to remaine about ſix weekes longer, to the end to expect an excellent oportunity, which then will offer it ſelfe vnto me to goe to the famous Riuer Ganges, about fiue daies iourny from this, to ſee a memorable meeting of the gentle people of this country called Baieans, whereof about foure hundred thouſand people go thither of purpoſe to bathe and ſhaue themſelues in the Riuer, and to ſacrifice a world of gold to the ſame Riuer, partly in ſtamped mony, & partly in maſſy great lumpes and wedges, throwing it into the Riuer as a ſacrifice, and doing other ſtrange Ceremonies moſt worthy the obſeruation, ſuch a notable ſpectacle it is, that\nno part of all Aſia, neither this which is called the great Aſia, nor the leſſer, which is now called Natolia, the like is to be ſeen; this ſhew doe they make once euery yeere, comming thither from places almoſt a thouſand miles off, and honour their Riuer as their God, Creator, and Sauiour; ſuperſtition and impiety moſt abominable in the higheſt degree of theſe brutiſh Ethnicks, that are aliens from Chriſt & the common-wealth of Iſrael. After I haue ſeen this ſhew, I wil with all expedition repaire to the city of Lahore, twenty daies iourny from this and ſo into Perſia by the helpe of my bleſſed Chriſt.\n            Thus haue I imported vnto you ſome good accidents that happened vnto me ſince I wrote a letter vnto you the laſt yeere from the Kings Court, & ſome litle part of my reſolution for the diſpoſing of a part of my time of abode in Aſia: Therefore now I will draw to a concluſion; the time I cannot limit when I ſhall come home, but as my mercifull God and Sauiour ſhall diſpoſe of it.

The truth\nis, Christian Religion truly so called, is so far from being\na Cause of Commotion or Disturbance in Kingdoms\nand States; that were there any Kingdom or\nState in the World, where Christian Religion were\ntruly taught and truly practised, it would be impossible\nthere should be any Dissention or Discord, any open\nRebellion, or privy Conspiracy, or any thing but\nConcord, Unity, and Peace in such a State or Kingdom:\nbecause all the Articles of the Christian faith, and", "image_url": "A70625/00008.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

{"sentence": "\n\n               The Introduction.\n               \nI Apprehend the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world groaning under the heavy burden of trouble and diſcontent, and (being now in travel) labours with no leſſe extremity of peril, then pangs, to be delivered.\nAnd although many of us may be apt to plead, that we have been ſo far from declining, as that we have laid hold upon every occaſion, and endeavoured to make a faithful improvement of all probable meanes that might tend to over-rule the torrent, and give ſtop to its violence: Yet I humbly ſay, that it's much below the power of any Mortall to conquer in ſuch conflicts, without a great meaſure of Divine aſſiſtance; and I am confident, that many by their frequent addreſſes, have ſolicited at Heavens Throne in that particular; Yethowever the Almighty may, for many cauſes beſt known to himſelf, for a time ſuſpend his help, though not abſolutely deny it, and alſo for ſome reſpects that fall within our knowledge. For it's not improbable, God does it to the end we may continue in a ſtate of dependance on him, that ſo, not onely thoſe other heavenly graces, that the Lord out of his immeaſurable bounty hath vouchſafed us, but our faith alſo may be exerciſed, which is very acceptable and wellpleaſing to his ſacred Majeſty.\n               And although we have formerly ſent up our ſupplications to Heaven for aide; perhaps we have at that very time, for our hearts are deceitfull beyond meaſure, had regard to ſome thing on earth, that in our apprehenſion ſeemed to hold forth ſatisfaction.\n\nNow this ground alone were enough to cauſe a ſuſpenſion of help. For Almighty God out of a tender regard to his glory, will not ſuffer any earthly thing to come in competition with heavenly; and as he would have his own way and meanes uſed towards the accompliſhing every end,ſo his holy Name chiefly glorifyed. But in regard I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more to this purpoſe, before I period my Epiſtle, I will in the next place endeavour to make inquiry after the cauſes, that might poſſibly uſher in our diſcontents, and uſe my beſt diligence to remove them, that ſo the effects may ceaſe.\n            \n\n               Twenty Quaer'es propounded.\n               1. ANd firſt, it will become us to enter into an exact ſcrutiny with our own hearts, and ask our ſouls this queſtion: Whether we have not ſet an over-endearing value upon ſublunary things, and upon that ſcore, contrary to intent and purpoſe of the great Creator and moſt wiſe Diſpoſer, advanced the ſervant above the maſter?\n2. Let us preſſe to know, how our hearts have stood affected to that which the world calls riches, then which nothing imaginable is more apt to attract the affections and ſeize upon the ſouls faculties, and thereby work a diverſion from matters of a more high and heavenly concernment?\n3. Have we not ſaid within our ſelves, that without riches men are confin'd to a ſtate of Penury, and therfore miſery, and that in reſpect of their poſſeſſion, the eſteem of men in their daies ebs and flowes proportionably?\n4. Hath it not troubled our ſpirits, that the ſole Giver of all things, hath vouch ſafed a larger Almes or diſtribution thereof to others, which in our apprehenſion, have leſſe deſerved then our ſelves; or advanced them to higher places of honour and repute, in reſpect of their authority amongſt men, and thereupon our eye hath become evil, becauſe our heavenly Fathers was good?\n\n5. Have we not given up our ſelves to an over-ſolicitous and indirect ſeeking after theſe momentany trifles?\n\n6. Have we not conniv'd at our own hearts, when they have bin ready to converſe with fraud and entertain conference with oppreſſion, or embrace any other ſiniſter courſe for the acquiring of worldly wealth?\n7. Have we not imployed our wits and abilities in procuring thereof, at ſuch times and ſeaſons, which God out of his wiſdome hath appointed more immediatelyfor the ſacred duties and performances that chiefly refer to his glory?\n8. Or at ſuch a time when for the crying ſins of a people, Judgement and Calamity is threatned, and is even ready to ſeize on every Family and Perſon in a Nation? For alas, when we ſhould endeavour by all meanes to appeaſe the wrath of an angry God, which we have ſhamefully provoked, it is then very unſeaſonable to ſeek after great things for our ſelves.\n9. Have we been faithful ſtewards of that portion, which the Lord in his providence hath afforded us?\n10. Have we relieved a diſciple in the name of a diſciple? Have we adminiſtred to the neceſſity of the Saints? Have we ſupplyed our diſtreſſed brethren in their exigents?\n11. Have we fed the hungry, clothed the naked? And have our bowels earned with compaſſion towards them in their extremities?\n12. And if our ſouls, upon private conference, can tell us that we have done this; Have we done it to a right end? Not for oſtentation or popular applauſe, nor at the over-inſtance of Friends,nor importunity of Allies, but in obedience to Gods command, and that his Name may have the Glory?\n               13. Have we upon this account been ready and willing to defray and lay out a great part of our ſubſtance for the purpoſes aforementioned, and for the advancement of piety, without repining and reluctancy?\n\n14. Have we not been filled with an over-high expectation of content, that we imagined might flow from creature-comforts?\n15. And have not our thoughts been taken up and poſſeſſed with more then is really to be found in them?\n16. Have we conſidered the many inconveniences that muſt inevitably attend all worldly enjoyments, though they preſent themſelves never ſo pleaſant and amiable to the eye of a facile apprehenſion?\n17. Though as to our own particular, Providence may ſeem to have ſhared out a leſſe pittance, then we think proportionable to the meanes we have uſed and the praiers we have put up for that purpoſe; have we conſidered that God in his wiſdome hath abundantly made it up to other members of the Myſtical body, thathave poſſibly ſuffered want in an higher degree, and have therefore ſtood in greater need then our ſelves?\n               18. Have we conſidered, that thoſe for whom God hath appointed an incorruptible inheritance that fades not away, in that Celeſtial Tabernacle not made with hands, the Heaven of heavens, have for the moſt part the meaneſt portion of outward things, and the leaſt of worldly comfort in their enjoyment?\n19. Have we conſidered that afflictions and troubles of the world, are in ſome degree the inſeparable companions of the choiſeſt Chriſtians? (Divine Writ imports no loſſe: Through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdome of Reſt.)\n20. Have we duely confidered upon what a ſlippery place & dangerous precipice all thoſe ſtand, that are incompaſſed about with ſuch a confluence of earthly endearments, and become ſuch ſlaves to their pleaſures, that they have ſcarce liberty to entertain a thought either of Heaven or Hell, Death or Judgement, God or Chriſt,unleſſe guided by an extraordinary principle of Grace?\n               Now as we tender the good of our own ſouls and hope for comfort, It behoves us to enter into a ſerious and impartial examination with our ſelves, and a due conſideration of each particular Quaere, and labour faithfully to know how much they concern us; and by how much we find our ſelves conſcious, as to a failing in that wherein by duty we were engaged the contrary, by ſo much we may humbly conclude that Divine pleaſure hath for a time given us over to a condition of trouble and diſcontent.\nObject. But you may be apt to ſay, that all this avails little to our help, and that it is a very harſh, if not, a prepoſterous way of cure to rip open cauſes after this manner.\n\n\nAnſw. I anſwer, that all cauſes art not eaſily, but with much difficulty removed, unleſſe well known. I have therfore taken liberty to inſiſt a little upon this courſe, wherein I have deſired to involve my ſelf, as well as others, not deſpairing of ſome advantage by it.\n\n\n               Inconveniences that attend diſcontent dilated.\n               IN the next place I ſhall ſet forth and dilate the many ſad and miſerable inconveniences that accompany a diſcontented condition; And firſt, it will be neceſſary to render a definition of this malady; And although we may know by too wofull experience what it is, yet it's not unſeaſonable to take notice thereof: And herein I ſhall not much differ from a knowing Author that pointed to the ſame particular.\nDiſcontent is a compoſition or mixture of two violent diſcompoſing paſſions, Anger, and Grief, both which ſtirre up fearful Tempeſts and beget cruel conflicts in the ſoul: As 'twas ſaid of Job (though a Mirrour of patience)Prov. 18.4. that he toar himſelf in his anger; and according to the Eccho of the choſen veſſelsvoice, the ſorrow of the world worketh death; ſo that either of which, though they encounter us ſingle, come not without their miſchiefs, and therefore of more danger, when their forces are united a in a confederacy or combination As firſt a diſcontented perſon he comes altogether indiſpoſed to every duty that referres to his ſpiritual or temporal condition; for ſo long as he macerates himſelf through his own diſtemper, the preaching of th\n•\n\nWord, the performance of Prayer, o\n•\n the adminiſtration of any Divine Ordinance to him, is little available A Lecture to a diſtracted (I had a\n•\n moſt ſaid to a dead) man is attended with as much efficacy:Prov. 15.13. For through a vexatious ſorrow of hea\n••\n the ſpirit is broken (ſaies the w\n••\n man) and ſo long as that continu\n•\n (as it were) disjointed, and in piec\n•\n it's altogether improbable that ſhould receive an impreſſion of goo\n•\n and bring forth fruit proportionably. Now herein, I would not be \n••\n\nſtaken, for it is not a Godly pententialſorrow that I ſpeak of, but a petulent vexatious trouble, that brings ſuch a diſcompoſure, and barrenneſs with it in reſpect of Good; For by the firſt (it muſt be confeſſed) that the ſpirit becomes more maleable, and of a more Divine and affable Temper, whereby the ſeed of the Word may take deeper root, and produce fruits anſwerably: In this caſe though the ſpirit may ſeem to be broken, yet no otherwiſe, then the ſuperficies of the earth is, when the Husband-man intends to caſt in grain; And as that by the influence of ſeaſonable diſtilling ſhowers is again compacted and conſolidated, without any prejudice to the crop; ſo a Chriſtians ſpirit (when ſoftned with a pious ſorrow) through the ſunſhine of divine diſpenſations, becomes more firmly cemented, and more fruitful then ever, being then in a better capacity to conform and yield obedience to the Apoſtles rule, in2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8. adding to Faith, vertue; and to vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge, Temperance; and to Temperance, Patienceand to patience, Godlineſſe; and to Godlineſſe, brotherly Kindneſſe; and to brotherly Kindneſſe, Charity; and thoſe in whom theſe things are and abound ſhall neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt (as the Apoſtle obſerves.)\n               Thus, having cleared my ſenſe in this partticular I ſhall wade further towards the diſcovery of thoſe inconveniences that attend diſcontent: And as I ſaid before, it workes an indiſpoſition to Good, ſo it alſo layes Men open and leaves them lyable to much evil; it's deplorable to think how many through the violence of that paſſion, have wilfully contracted the ſpanne of their life, by an untimely death, and made themſelves more miſerable by their diſtemper, then the Almighty ha\n•\n done by croſſes: Alas! how apt \n•\n that deſtroying enemy of Mankin\n•\n (Satan) (who watcheth every o\n•\n caſion, and attends every oportu\n•\n\nty to advance his kingdome of da\n•\n\nneſſe to ſeize upon a diſcontent ſpirit, as being then moſt likelywork its overthrow, either by aggravation of its miſery, or ſome other inſinuating ſuggeſtions? And on the other hand, How do thoſe inſnaring ſubtilties, and deceitful allurements of the world, make it their advantage to encounter a ſpirit in diſtraction, as then ſuppoſing it to have caſt off the protection of the meek ſpirit of patience (the beſt armour againſt ſuch aſſaults?) Nor will a third dangerous enemy (the fleſh) be idle at ſuch a time, but fly out into rebellion and leavy war againſt the Law of the mind, and ſo ſubject it to the law of ſinne, Thus we ſee what a conſpiracy of evil Inſtruments there is to deſtroy poor ſouls. that are involved in this malady: Oh! then what a madneſſe is it for contemptible clay to contend with the Potter that can faſhion and mould it as he pleaſeth! Oh! What a ſenceles thing is it, for a man to torment himſelf and harraze his own ſoul with the vexatious thoughts of thoſe evils, that are beyond all remedy! He that ſpurnnes againſtpikes of Iron, can in reaſon expect to gain nothing but wounds: He that willingly runs againſt a rock, not only daſhes the veſſel in pieces, but loſes all the fraught: for he that entertaines or gives way to diſcontent, not only torments the body, but alſo caſts the ſoules welfare into extremity of hazard. What will not a man do in the midſt of this paſſion? He'le create quarrels with men, and ſometimes with thoſe of neereſt Relation to him, without any colour of cauſe, and ſo both betray his folly, and run himſelf into a guilt of groſſe enormities: And which is more ſad, he'le not ſtick to quarrel and contend with God himſelf, if any thing be preſented contrary to his liking, or offer to thwart his humour.\n               What an hanious crime was it in that diſcont ented Prophet, ſo vainly and furiouſly to conteſt with his Maker, about ſuch a trivial thing, as a withered Gourd? And it could not but afflict good Jacob, (more then the ſterility of his wife)to hear her queratouſly cry outGen. 30.1.\nGive me children or elſe I die; as though Providence were confined either to grant her deſire or accompliſh her ruine; The latter is often true, if the firſt be inordinately ſought after or unſeaſonably ſued for: and this is very obſerveable, that thoſe who are exceſſively given up to the bent of their own wills, (When they ſee it diſproportionable to the Will of the moſt High) do not only meet with grievous Troubles from within themſelves, but for the moſt part, heavy Judgements from God: and thus it was with the murmuring and repining Iſraelites, who becauſe they had not every thing they deſired, eſteemed ſlightly of what they had; and becauſe they were not exactly humoured, became wilfully ingrateful and therefore were juſtly purſued with multiplyed judgements.\n               What a deteſtable humour was that in Ahab, who within the confines of all Iſrael could not ſind matter enough to feed his hungry deſire, nor ſatisfy his diſcontented cravingmind, unleſſe he might enjoy Naboths poor Vineyard? What an high contempt of the Almighties Munificence and bounty was this; that he could not content himſelfe with a Kingdome, but labour with ſo much vehemency to gratifie his corrupt pleaſure with ſuch an inconſiderable trifle?\n               And to proceed yet further, diſcontent is the mother of diſorder; it devides and ſubdevides not onely the ſenſes but the faculties, and ſets them at an irreconcileable diſtance and enmity one with another, and through this fewd and oppoſition they debilitate and weaken each other, whereby that naturall and inherent life and vigour, whence there ſhould proceed lively and perfect Iſſues, (being thus decayed) produceth little but obliquities, and effect of decrepit nature.\nMoreover he that is perplext i\n•\n mind, ſeldome acts any thing that either pleaſeth himſelf or another thoſe actions and carriages that \n••\n late to his own particular, are forthe moſt part looked upon with an evil eye, as carrying along with them direful troubles, doubts and diſquieting Moleſtations: and ſo being diſcompoſed and out of frame, it cannot be expected, that thoſe actings which refer to others, ſhould be any waies proportioned to their deſires, or ſuited to their pleaſures: But alas! this is not the worſt, (although bad enough to be oppoſed both to ones own and others advantage) for he that diſcontentedly troubles himſelf for outward things (either in reſpect of their miſcarryage, for that they have not directly occurred to his humour and given full anſwer to his expectation; or in regard of the deprivation of thoſe enjoyments, on which his heart hath been ſet, but now irrecoverably loſt) runs in a Dyametricall oppoſition to the rule of Gods word manifeſted in ſacred writ (which ought to be the guide of every mans life and actions) and thereby extremly diſpleaſeth and irritates the Majeſty of the moſt High, then which nothing in the world isof a more lamentable conſequence.\n               Thus (Sir) I have in ſome degree endeavoured to make a true diſcovery of thoſe miſeries and inconveniences that accompany diſcontent, and have accordingly given an account, of ſome of thoſe many dangers, wherein a troubled and diſſatisfyed perſon is involved: And although you may meet with a more ample and compleat diſcovery (in relation to this particular) then this of mine, as proceeding from thoſe of larger experience and riper judgement; yet as an exact proportioniſt will portray the whole ſtature of Hercules by the print of his foot, ſo may you by that skantling I have here given, and that little I have ſaid, gueſſe, what may be farther offered to this purpoſe.\nObject. But perhaps you'le ſay, I ſtand at a great diſtance from the cure, and that inſtead of applying comfortable cordialls I have uſed cutting and corroding Gorraſives, which only tend to the aggravation of affliction, and not to the extenuation of grief; And that I have invertedthat order, which compaſſion engages me to proceed in, in maladies of this nature; and deal like an hard-hearted Chirurgian, that extends his probe to a painful ſearch, by ripping the wound, and terrifying his Patient with the danger thereof, before he powre in one drop of balſome, or apply one healing medicine.\n\n\nAnſw. To all which I ſay; that although I have been a little ſtrict in the inquiry after the cauſes, and laying down the effects of this diſtemper, yet I hope, my method and manner herein, hath been no other, then what may very well conſiſt with our comfort and ſatisfaction; Though for the preſent, it may ſeem ſomething harſh and diſconſolate (eſpecially to ſuch, as have had experience of, and acquaintance with tryals and diſpenſations of this nature:) Yet nevertheleſſe I doubt not (through Divine Aſſiſtance) to preſcribe and offer, ſome ſuch effectual meanes, as may very probably tend to over-rule the diſtemper, drive away the diſeaſe, and conſequently eſtate us in a condition of content.\n\n\n1. PARAGRAPH: Twenty particulars pointed at and inſiſted on.\n               ANd in my apprehenſion there \n〈◊〉\n not any thing more conſiderable or more effectually conducible then unto then to poſſeſſe our hearts with a conſideration of the Inſtabilitie \n〈◊〉\n variableneſſe of all things here \n〈◊〉\n low; For without doubt, if \n〈◊〉\n were ſeriouſly and imparti\n••\n weighed, the tranſitory trifles \n〈◊〉\n this life, would fall farre ſh\n•••\n of that high valuation, which m\n•••\n men unadviſedly put upon them \n〈◊〉\n theſe daies; Nor can any thing \n〈◊〉\n reaſon be alleadged for ſuch \n〈◊〉\n eſteem, if we do but duly conſider, th\n•\n there was never yet any one in the world, that upon infallible ground could promiſe and aſſure himſelfe the enjoyment of any ſublun\n••\nfelicity, for the continuance of one day, which is but a ſmall time compared with a mans life, and the longeſt tract of ones life, is but as a ſpan in reſpect of eternity: For firſt either the wiſe diſpoſer may ſuddenly take them away from us, or us from them; If we look upon our ſelves in the largeſt dimenſion and higheſt capacity over the creatures, we ſhall find that we are but ſtewards, and ſtewards muſt either quit, or account for their imployment when their maſters pleaſe.\n               All earthly things we do enjoy, are but ours upon condition; and how prone and ready the beſt of men are, to faile, on their parts, I leave to every experient and rational man to judge; I might dilate this into ſeveral particulars, and diſcover by how many waies and meanes, we may be deprived of outward enjoyments, and by what deviſes they may be ſnatcht from us: but that amongſt other things I ſhall transfer to our own thoughts, in regard it would ſwell this diſcourſe beyondits intended limit, and render it \n〈◊〉\n ther a volume, then Epiſtle: therefore next let's conſider how ſoo\n••\n we may be taken from the world who can aſſure himſelf of a mi\n•••\n time? Though he be indued wid never ſo much wiſedome, ſtrengthned with never ſo much power, an compaſſed about with all the huma\n••\n\n helpes and advantages that can co\n••\n within the circuit of his imaginatin yet as the Pſalmiſt ſaies, his ſoul is \n••\n tinually in His hands, nor does he \n〈◊〉\n but that it may expire in his next breath\n•••\n\n Alas! The life of man is but like bubble, and how ſoon that vaniſhe\n••\n away (even before we can well apprehend it) experience tell us: or like the drop of a bucket, or the duſt of a b\n•\nllance that's ſhaken off and buried from our view, by the leaſt motion: or like Jonas his gourd that was faire and flouriſhing over night but withered and dead the next morning.\n               How many have retyred to their evening habitations with intent to take their healthful repoſe: andin order thereunto, have ſhut their eyes in a natural ſleep, but never waked, except in another World? Hence we may gather how fragle and brittle a thing mans life is, even like a glaſſe that by how much the finer it is, by ſo much it is the eaſier broken: or like a twined thred, which how ſoon it's cut a ſunder, all men know; Therefore it argues a great meaſure of weakneſs and inconſideratneſſe in us, if we look not upon each day, as if it were the laſt, that's allowed to our Pilgrimage: why ſhould we eſteem our ſelves in a better condition then good St. Paul Who1 Cor. 15.31.\nproteſted by that rejoicing he had in Chriſt Jeſus to dy dayly? What a miſerable poor complaint was that of one of the Roman Emperours, (Titus Veſpaſian that great conquerour of the Jewes) who being ſeized on by ſickneſſe, and conveyed in a litter, lookes forth, and with much indignation quarrels with and accuſes heaven for that he muſt die, and had not deſerved it? When alas! ſilly Mortall, if he had but conſidered hewas a man, it had been guilt enough and for which nature might juſt pronounce her ſentence of dea\n•\n againſt him: But he had been ſo pu\n••\n up with the honour and ſucceſſe his high Achievements, that he co\n••\n not entertaine any thoughts \n〈◊〉\n parting with this, and embaacing better life: and I heartily wiſh th\n•\n crime did not cry aloud in our dai\n•\n and that mens minds were leſſe taken up, and their thoughts leſſe i\n•\n ployed about ſecular affaires, a\n•\n the fading trifles of this world, a\n•\n more intent on thoſe ſpiritu\n•\n things, that might advance a mo\n•\n glorious Kingdome, wherein th\n•\n ſouls might be happied with an eternal welfare.\n               I am perſwaded that the defe\n••\n on of moſt men in this particulariſes through the want of due co\n•\n\nſideration of the vanity of earth things.\nWhat conſiderate man wo\n••\n doate upon that goblin honor, t\n••\n cannot be fitter compared then \n〈◊〉\n meer ſhadow, which upon the \n〈◊〉\ninterpoſure of a cloud is quite gone, without ſo much as leaving the leaſt mention where it was? To this purpoſe obſerve the words of a learned Author: The ſame Sun (ſaies he) ſees Haman adored in the Perſian Court like ſome Earthly Deity, and like ſome baſe vermine waving upon a Gibbet: Do we ſee the great and glorious Cleopatra ſhining in the pompous Majeſty of Egypt? Stay but a while, and you ſhall ſee her in the duſt, and her two children whom ſhe proudly ſtiled the ſun & the moon, driven like miſerable Captives before the chariot of their Conquerour.\n\nPſal. 49.12. Man being in honour abides not (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) he periſheth, but his greatneſſe (as more frail then he) is oftimes dead and buried before him, and leaves him the ſurviving executor of his own ſhame: Much more of vanity might be diſcovered in this trifling ſhadow (Honour.)\nAnother thing which ſurpriſes the eye of the world, is Beauty, and that, if rightly conſidered, is but a ſading flower which the revolutionof one daies time, beholds both its glory and ruine, its birth and burial.\n               It's no other then a light touch of natures tincture caſt upon the skinne, and how ſuddenly that's wiped off with a little ſickneſſe or other caſualty, experience tells us: He that had the choiſe of many thouſand faces, (as well as a plenitude of all other enjoyments) could ſay towards the period of his Proverbs,Prov. 31.30. that favour is deceitful, and beauty is vanity; whereof wee may be very credulous, ſince we know not a more valid authority, then this of the wiſe-mans, that will maintain the contrary.\nNor does Strength and Vigour of bodie (which is more chiefly appropriated to our own ſex) carry with it a leſſe proportion of frailty, then the former: for though we could ſuſteine and hold it up to its ultimate tearm, till hoary old age ſeize upon us; Alas! that's but a ſhort time; it greetes us before we be aware, often letting us know, by its decaying effects, that it hath usby the hand; it ſhrivels our fleſh that before was brawney; weakens our ſinues, that lately were ſtrong, and criples our joints that were nimble and active, and ſteales away (though almoſt by inſenſible degrees) that natural heat and vigorous warmth, whereby every part became enlivened and comfortably refreſhed. But it may be obſerved, that many times, either ſolitary ſickneſſe or ſome waſting malady, prevents the decayings and debilitations of age, and ſo ſubjects the ſtouteſt man to a low condition, and pulls the ſtrongeſt upon his knees, cauſing him to confeſſe with the holy Preacher, thatEccleſ. 11.10.\nyouth as well as childhood is vanity. Another thing which ſeizes many, and hurries them headlong to their own ruine (unleſs well grounded upon pious principles) is an Exceſſe of worldly Pleaſures, which may not improperly be called vanity in the abſtract, a meer extempory flaſh, far more imaginary, then real, which for the moſt part dies in the birth: But admit them petmanent; yet the conſiderationof thoſe direful effects they produce, adminiſters matter enough for a loathing & deteſtation of them, & ground enough to deterre every conſciencious Chriſtian from an eager purſuit after them, or delight in them.\n               One would tremble to think what dangerous incendiaries they are to luſt; and that ſo emaſculates all the powers of the ſoul, that its nobleſt operations become brutiſh: It begets a wanton eye, a laſcivious eare, obſcene talk, unclean and filthy jeſts; beſides many other ſecret abominations, not to be conceived without horrour, much leſſe to be mentioned.\nTherefore if we look upon ſenſual pleaſures, as they are in themſelves vain and tranſitory; or in their vile conſequenſes baſe and impious, they deſerve not to have harbour in a ſober mind: but rather to be ejected and utterly baniſhed from our thoughts, as contemptible, and unworthy of our notice.\nThus I have plainly laid down the vanity and ſhort continuance oftheſe laſt mentioned earthly felicities; and we may be ſatisfyed, that all other temporal enjoyments are ſubject to the ſame fate and mortality. What can we fix our eyes upon, that does not admoniſh us of our frailty? Do not all our fellowcreatures dy for us or by us? The brightſome cheerful day, diſſolves into dark and melancholy night: The fruit-bearing-trees, and other pleaſant plants of the earth, ſuffer an Autumnal nakedneſſe: The beautiful face of that common mother of us all, doth once in each twelve moneths time reſemble death. Oh! what a ſtupendious height of madneſs is it in any worthles miſerable mortal, to think he can extract a continuance of happineſs out of an inch of time! That Chymiſtry or ſacred art is onely proper to him, to whom all things are poſſible: That Almighty power can draw forth the vaſt ſpaces of eternity out of a moment of time; can contract the ſwelling Ocean into the compaſs of a nut-ſhell, and the capacious Earthinto a grain of ſand, and is able to accompliſh thoſe things, which are tenne thouſand degrees beyond the reach of all humane capacity and imagination.\n               Do we then upon ſerious conſideration manifeſtly diſcern the fading tranſitorineſſe of accumulated Riches, of adored Honour, of ſhining Beauty, of vigorous Strength, of delightful Pleaſures; yea and of Life it ſelf, and whatever elſe can be eſteemed as dear and precious to us in this world; and can we (upon ſecond thoughts) ſo fix our hearts on them, and doat after them, as to be troubled and dejected with our parting from them? Sure it betraies a great meaſure of folly in any one to bewaile and afflict himſelf for the loſſe of that which he knowes muſt certainly decay and vaniſh: yet ſuch is the nature and condition of earthly-minded-men, whoſe wills are ſo vitiated, affections miſguided, and underſtandings dark'ned, that they cannot ſee further. But wiſe Chriſtians will value good things accordingto their continuance, and therefore ſet their hearts upon thoſe unſpeakable, and inviſſible comforts of a better life; as knowing (or at leaſt truly believing) that the things which are not ſeen, are both happy and eternal.\n               Therefore let's be perſwaded, as a counter-ballance to the Creatures vanity (having already ſeen how fraile and tranſitory all outward and earthly enjoyments are, though their enticements be never ſo many, and ſeem to hold forth promiſes of a faire and pleaſing nature) ſtead faſtly ſo ſix our ſoules on thoſe things which are of a more Celeſtiall concernment, thoſe ineſtimable Riches that are treaſured up in heaven, where neither moth nor ruff can ever poſſibly corrupt, nor theeves breake through and ſteale, which are beyond all thoughts of diminution or decay. Oh that we could ſatisfy our ſelves with an holy and humble contemplation of thoſe unſpeakable and unparallell'd joies, wherewith the glorifyed Saints and Angels areperpetually happied, and whereof there is a plentiful portion reſerved and appointed (through the bountiful providence of the moſt High) for every true pious believer! If we do but caſt our ſouls upon that immoveable rock (Chriſt Jeſus) and lay hold on him by a ſtedfaſt faith, we may be confident, there ſhall not be one mercy, that reſpects our eternal happineſſe, withheld from us, as is very clear and evident by ſacred Scripture-authority. What perſon then, that hath but a ſparke of grace, can afflict and macerate himſelf, for the want and deprivation of thoſe creature-comforts, which are doom'd to a fading mortality, when he may upon ſuch ſoul-ſolacing, and ſaving tearmes become undoubted heire of all thoſe glorious promiſes, that are recorded in Holy Writ, (in and through the merits of Chriſt) and have as great a ſhare in that heavenly inheritance, as the higheſt Angel hath? I ſay, then who would trouble himſelf about the trifles of this world?\n            \n\n2. PARAGRAPH.\n               FOr although there be a confluence and continuance of all earthly endearments; yet they fall infinitely ſhort of ſatisfaction; which is another particular I ſhall crave leave to inſiſt on; not doubting to offer ſomething that may not onely appear, but prove conſiderable. As firſt, ſuppoſe that Life it ſelf (without which all earthly things amount to nothing) were protracted to the utmoſt length of Methuſala his age; and then withall conſider that original guilt and corruption, which is derived from the loines of our firſt Parents, whereby our whole man became depraved, and loſt, (in reſpect of our firſt ſtate of innocency) and alas! we ſhall find very ſmall ſatisfaction in this length of daies: we ſhould be either much unſatisfyed, and out of order: we ſhould growinſufferably weary of our ſelves, and of the world, making it our dayly ſuite to be diſſolved, and ſo exiled from, this unpleaſing Pilgrimage.\nIf we caſt our eyes on thoſe, whoſe age Providence hath drawn forth but to ſeventy or eighty years, for the moſt part we ſee them miſerably tired and incumbred, crying and calling out for death, to releaſe them from that burden. And certainly, if their lives ſhould run forth into a larger term, it would be attended with a greater meaſure of toilſomeneſſe and trouble.\nThen again, admit that to length of daies there were added, a fulneſſe of earthly bleſſings, and thoſe freed from many perplexities and grievances, wherewith they are commonly accompanied; yet very little ſatisfaction could the ſoul receive from them, or find in them: For without doubt if any thing of true contentment and of a comfortable durance could have been found i\n•\n them, Great and wiſe Solomon, that had the full command and enjoymentof them all, upon the faireſt conditions that the earth could allow, would have afforded them a more favourable Character, then vanity of vanities: and why we ſhould expect more from them, that have them upon far meaner termes, then that wiſe Monarch had, is to me no leſſe then a Paradox? Nor can I rationally apprehend, why any ſhould promiſe to himſelf a felicity in thoſe things, which daily and hourly experience renders not only diſſatisfactory but miſerable. If we look upon the rich and covetous perſon (for indeed they are ſeldome ſeparable) who, though he hath heaped up worldly wealth, to a ſeeming inexhauſtible ſtore, and as much as would probably ſatisfy many moderateminded-men; yet we ſhall hear him expreſſe a want of ſomething, ſtill vehemently craving, and inordinately deſiring more: Though his ſubſtance be never ſo vaſt, it's too poor and narrow for his avaritious mind: The eye and the ear (thoſe twins and purveyors for the fleſh) ſtill remainunſatisfyed, and thereupon the heart ſaies, it's not enough: the more it hath, the more it craves; diſcontentedly afflicting it ſelf, when it cannot attain to the utmoſt extent, of its boundleſſe and unlimited deſire. Nor is the proud and ambitious man leſſe perplext, when he cannot reach to the height of that honour, which his lofty ſpirit looks at: His aſpiring thoughts will prompt him to leave no waies or meanes unaſſayed (though never ſo dangerous and unwarrantable) whereby he may poſſibly accompliſh that, which his thirſty mind aimes at; as we may plainly ſee in Hamans caſe. If in the next place we obſerve the Voluptious perſon, who bathes himſelf in pleaſures, and ſwims through times ſwift current, with as much vain mirth and jollity, as a created capacity can ſuggeſt; yet all this ſuffices not, ſo light and airie are all delights of this nature, that they paſſe away like a ſhadow, and are many times gone in the very moment of their enjoying; In ſo muchthat for the moſt part thoſe men which are voluptuouſly given, are forced to feed their humours upon a ſtock of paſt pleaſures, ſuffering their thoughts to run over with a kind of pleaſing liberty (though indeed a moſt ſinful licen ciouſneſſe) the former paſſages of their vitious and voluptuous lives. And all this (if rightly conſidered) is ſo farre from adminiſtring true content, that it aggravates their miſery, by contracting a double depravity and guilt upon their own ſouls, which will one day reflect upon their miſcarriages with ſorrow and ſadneſſe, and bitterly condemne their own folly for giving way to ſuch irreligious and horrible courſes.\n               Further if we look upon the Strong and Valiant man, we ſhall ſee how fraile and unſatisfying that is (as I have before more fully declared) and how ſoon the moſt active and vigorous ſtrength becomes weakneſſe, either through the decaying of age, ſickneſſe, or other accidents. Sampſon (ſo famous in Holy Writ)that had as much cauſe to boaſt of himſelf in that particular as ever any, having thereby done ſuch unparallell'd things, as almoſt exceeded beliefe; yet how ſuddenly he was bereft of all that power and ſtrength (Judg 16.17. after he had diſcovered the cauſe thereof to his Dalilah) is notoriouſly known. I might runne into \n〈◊〉\n multitude of Inſtances, of the creatures diſſatisfaction, were it not rather to protract time, then afford content. Therefore in a word. thus That if all the pleaſures and profits, earthly concernments and enjoyments of ten thouſand worlds were heaped together, and became a monopoly; There is not ſo much efficacy to be found in all as would ſatiate the deſires of one Immortal ſoul and the reaſon is this; for that they are of a fraile and finite nature; and the ſoul purely infinite; they are material, but the ſoul immateriall; they are of a droſſy ſubſtance, but the ſoul made up of heavenly faculties; ſo that there can be no more true fellowſhip betwixt them thenthere is betwixt light and darkneſſe, which ſtand at an irreconcileable diſtance.\n               Therefore ſince it appears that the choiſeſt of all outward endearments are ſo little ſatisfying, (or rather ſo much diſſatisfactory) It may induce us to give them a proportionable value and no more, and to ſix our hearts and affections on thoſe higher things that are of a more durable ſubſtance; which we may be certain will not perturb our ſpirits, nor ſubject us to this deſtroying diſtemper of diſcontent.\n\n\n3. PARAGRAPH.\n               ANd becauſe there may be ſome in the world that are more apt to be deterred from what they encline to, by an apprehenſion of danger then any other conſideration; I ſhall therefore now ſhew, how perillous it is, to overprize earthlycomforts; and that will appear, f\n••\n in regard it affronts the majeſty \n〈◊〉\n the moſt High: for we leſſen th\n•\n eſteem, which we ought to entertain of the Almighty, when w\n•\n overvalue thoſe things which a\n•\n ſubordinate: then conſequent\n•\n this error muſt be acknowledged to be exceeding dangerous: Oh! How can that God endure, (whoſe bounty freely di\n•\n\npenſeth it ſelf to the relief of a\n•\n thoſe that have intereſt and affiance in him) to ſee his creatures value above himſelf! It will vex a natural man to ſee his favours feaſted o\n•\n and his perſon contemned, to b\n•\n beaten with his own weapon; Ho\n•\n may it much more provoke the fie\n•\n\n anger of the Omnipotent God to brea\n•\n forth and conſume thoſe that crea\n•\n to themſelves an heaven on Earth who though they live and ſubſiſt upon mercy, yet under value the Gr\n•\n Giver and Author of it: For this \n〈◊〉\n undenyable that where the creatu\n•\n is overvalued the Creator is under valued; and (to ſpeak it with reverence)we do then as much as in us lies to degrade the Deity, and debaſe the Majeſty of our heavenly Father: we ought to be very circumſpect in this particular, and armed with abundance of caution, againſt the inſinuations and attempts of our ſubtile and deceitful enemies who ly in waite, and are ever ready to prompt us to enormities of this nature. Satan ſeeks all advantages to withdraw our affections from God, and to that end preſents us with the world laid forth in all its variety, and in its moſt amiable dreſſe, and if that take us, he hath gained great part of his deſigne; for by the next degree he thinks to make us his own: And then the World, though a ſeeming friend, becomes a reall enemy, and contributes to Satans Deſign, and like a cheating Gameſter ſuffers us to win at firſt, that at laſt he may go away with all: He courts us with ſmiling flateries and pleaſing pretences, untill he hath engaged us; and then he makes us vaſſals.\n               Nor are our corruptions idle, butready to entertain the worlds \n〈◊〉\n braces, and like Tinder fly in\n••\n flame upon the firſt touch. In \n〈◊〉\n regard we ought to be very car\n••\n how and upon what termes we \n〈◊〉\n verſe with the world, that we \n〈◊〉\n not be involved in danger. \n〈◊〉\n fulneſſe of the earth is made u\n••\n many ingredients, and though t\n••\n are for the moſt part of a groſs nat\n••\n and therefore leſſe taking; yet \n〈◊〉\n are mixt with ſome that have a\n••\n ring baits, and ſo attract our affe\n••\n\nons; when alas, in the end they \n〈◊〉\n into emptines and can never ſat\n••\n the better part of man (the ſo\n••\n but many times hazard the loſſ\n••\n that moſt precious Jewel, that \n〈◊〉\n ſo dearly purchaſed with an In\n••\n\nmable Price, (the Innocent bl\n••\n of the Lord Jeſus) to recover which the powers on earth cannot lend \n〈◊〉\n leaſt aſſiſtance.\n               And that which yet brings m\n••\n danger, the fulneſſe of the world tainted with poiſon, with ſinne \n〈◊〉\n the curſe of God. And what pl\n••\n\nſure can any man take to drinkthat cup that's mixt with poiſon, though it be never ſo ſweet and delicious to the taſte? Beſides it's a moſt defiling ſubſtance; for whatſoever the heart converſes with that's worſe then it ſelf, it receives pollution thence and ſo becomes corrupted. And though we have never ſo great a ſhare of this fulneſſe, it falls below our expectation, ſinck it as lowe as we can. And that which is yet more dangerous; It coſts us many thouſand times more then it is worth: our precious time, which was a lot\n\n•\nd us for a better improvement; our \n•\nar and daily thoughts that were given us to feed on higher things? and often takes up our Immortal ſouls which ſhould not fix on finite objects: that here's a large ſtock laid out \n〈◊〉\n it: abundance of care to get it; extremity of fear to keep it; and many times exceeding much grief to \n••\nſe it. And being obtained and \n••\nheld with all this difficulty: it \n•\nay make us miſerable, but dever tru\n\n••\n make us happy. Oh! Then, \n•\nhat man alive (unleſſe he be givenover to act his own ruin) that ha\n••\n a God to ſerve, and a ſoul to ſa\n••\n an heaven to hope for, and an h\n••\n to fear; ſins to avoid, and Gra\n••\n to acquire; will imploy his tis\n••\n his thoughts, his intereſt to beco\n••\n the world's Favourite, when the \n〈◊〉\n fruition of earthly things in th\n••\n higheſt felicity appears ſo dangerous? Let's rather be willing to p\n••\n with all that's dear and delight to us in this life, then run ſo g\n••\n an hazard as the diſpleaſure of G\n••\n and the loſſe of our own ſouls. L\n••\n be ready upon every occaſion to \n〈◊〉\n off theſe incumbrances, that imp\n••\n our progreſſe in our ſpiritual cou\n••\n and chearfully embrace thoſe hel\n••\n and advantages that may direct \n〈◊〉\n further us in our way to hea\n••\n ward, where we ſhall enjoy hon\n••\n without envy; ſollace without \n〈◊〉\n row; felicity without frailty; \n〈◊〉\n comfort without end.\n            \n\n4. PARAGRAPH.\n               HAving laid down the danger that involves all thoſe whoſe hearts are let forth to an over-high valuing of creature-comforts: I ſhall next examine, what a perplexity and diſtemper is uſually wrought both in the bodies and ſouls of thoſe that have over-full eſtates: and alſo what a torment it is to them, when they are forced to part with them, or otherwiſe ſuffer a declenſion in their honour and greatneſſe, (eſpecially if they be ſuch as are meerly morall.) Experience tells us, that exceſs is attended with ſickneſs, and ſuperfluity produces a world of diſeaſes, neither of which are ordinarily attained to without over-plentifull, eſtates. Obſerve that man whoſe curious and craving palate is ſuch, that he cannot endure to ſatisfy himſelf with ſome diſhes that are choice,but will extend his command to \n〈◊〉\n ſuperfluous variety of them, an\n•\n after he hath fed ſo long as natur\n•\n will admit him, many times quarre\n•\n with himſelf, becauſe his ſtoma\n••\n will not receive another courſe o\n••\n choicer morſels, but becomes glu\n••\n\n upon the very ſight of them: ſo tha\n•\n hence proceed ſurfets, feavouri\n••\n diſtempers, and abundance of othe\n•\n maladies that cry out for the Phyſician; who ſhall now be in more reque\n••\n then the Cook, and a ſecond ſickneſ\n••\n muſt endeavour to cure the firſt. Th\n••\n health which is one of the greate\n•\n of ſublunary mercies, muſt be wantonly deſtroyed, or at leaſt be ſ\n•\n impaired, as will render ſuch a perſon in a decaying ſickly condition ſo long as his life laſts: When o\n•\n the contrary he to whom provident hath allowed a ſmall portion in thi\n•\n world, eats and drinks proportionably, and ſo lives at a comfortable diſtance from ſuch diſtempers.\n               Beſides, ſo great are the troubles tha\n•\n for the moſt part waite on a ful\n•\n eſtate, that me thinks a due conſideration of them, might enduce us to reſt ſatisfyed with a little. Firſt, Envy is an unavoidable companion of Greatneſſe, this body can never walk without that ſhadow, they are inſeparable: when on the contrary it ſcarce ever looks at a mean Condition: low ſhrubs are ſeldome ſtruck with lightning; It is the lofty proud Cedars that are moſt lyable to thoſe devouring flames. David while he tended his fathers flocks lived merrily and without diſturbance; but when he once approaches the Court (though by Sacred Election and Appointment) and becomes arreſted with applauſe and greatneſſe; then emulation and envy, deſpight and malice, purſue him cloſe at the heels; and though he forſake the Court, and wander in the Wilderneſſe, thither theſe blood-hounds follow him: If he fly to the land of the Philiſtines, they'le find him out, and chaſe him to Ziklag: and though at laſt he arrive at his juſt Throne, and there hopes to breath a little after all theſe tedious Encounters, yet ſtill he's accoſted with unquietneſſe,and forced in a moſt patheticall and ſenſible manner to cry outPſa. 132.1.\nLord remember David and all his troubles. Thus, many are betrayed by their wealth; and their very greatneſſe creates a Judge to condemne them as malefactors.\n               He that falls from an high precipice, cannot probably avoid bruiſes; but he that ſuffers a fall on even ground, is lyable to little or no harm. Is it not then much better to be ſafe in a lowe condition then mounted high and ſubject to ſo much peril? And then further, greatneſs can never continue without vexatious and diſquieting cares; that are ever ready to perplex both bed and board, to diſtract our ſleep, diſguſt our meat, embitter our pleaſures, and ſhorten our daies. Nor are the holyeſt of men free or exempted from theſe perturbations: By how much the higher they are advanced in outward things, ſo much the more trouble and vexation they ſhall meet with (either in reſpect of inſtruments or otherwiſe) in the managery ofthoſe affaires: For where earthly promotion is, diſtraction (in ſome degree) inſeparably attends it. That made Gregory, (none of the worſt Biſhops of Rome) paſſionately complain of the clog of his high preferment, confeſſing though he was outwardly advanced, he was inwardly debaſed; and that the burthen of his honour did inſufferably depreſſe him, and his innumerable cares diſquiet him on all ſides. It was obſerved by the Jewiſh Doctors, that Joſeph the Patriarch, was of a ſhorter life then the reſt of his brethren, And this reaſon they render of it, that his cares were ſo much the more and greater, as his place and imployment was higher.\n               And further, ſad experience tells us, that Honour is rarely upheld without ſinne, and that grievous temptations follow great Eſtates. The1 Tim. 6.9, 10. holy Apoſtle Paul brands wealth with deceitfulneſſe; for that it cheates many men of their ſoules, and ſo robbes them of thoſe everlaſting treaſures, that are preſerved from allcorruption and decay, whereof they might have been made partakers, \n〈◊〉\n not their hearts been inordinately\n\n〈◊〉\n on this thick clay, this mammon of th\n•\n world.\n               And it is incredible to think, wit\n•\n what torment earthly men part wi\n••\n this traſh. How many men have lo\n••\n their lives, rather then they woul\n•\n loſe their bagges; or at leaſt runn\n•\n themſelves into ſuch extremity \n〈◊〉\n danger to preſerve them, that they have ever after lived miſerably? B\n••\n that which is yet more in ſufferably grievous and lamemtable, is the grea\n••\n Account that will inevitably ſuccee\n•\n theſe large entertainements, at th\n•\n laſt and General day of Judgement when every one ſhall be ſummone\n•\n to anſwer for what hath been don\n•\n in the fleſh, and how they have imployed (or rather improved) thoſe Talents they have been intruſted with. Oh! How terrible will it be then for thoſe to appear before the Majeſty of Heaven, that have made Gold their God? That in this life have doated upon a moment oftime, and ſo much ſleighted the vaſt ſpaces of eternity? Sure it muſt be very difficult, (if not impoſſible) for ſuch to make a faire reckoning, in the failing whereof they become perpetually miſerable. And that conſcience that before ſeemed dead, will contribute to the ſoules affliction and ſorrow, and bring freſh to mind thoſe evils it hath formerly delighted in.\n               Now if theſe ſeveral particulars be ſummed up, as firſt, thoſe tedious indiſpoſitions and diſtempers of body, occaſioned through an Exceſſe: Then thoſe extraordinary troubles and perplexities of mind raiſed by inordinate and ſollicitous cares, for the ſupport of greatneſſe; together with that Mortall hatred and ſinful emulation incident to a full Eſtate; beſides the vexation in parting with, and torment in accounting for this worldly pelfe; and that which is moſt dreadful, the hazard of loſing our Immortall ſouls: certainly theſe conſiderations duely weighed, and ſeriouſly thought on, have ſufficientforce to deterre any ſober minded Chriſtian from running on to a delight of theſe droſſey and perplexing vanities, theſe rotten earthly treaſures. Therefore ſteadfaſtly eyeing theſe many Inconveniences, we ought rather earneſtly to pray, that we may be freed from the occaſions of them, (which appears by what hath been ſaid, to be outward pompe and ſecular greatneſſe) then in the leaſt meaſure to be afflicted for the want of them, when at beſt and in their higheſt capacity, they may perplex us, but never really content us.\n               Object. It may be objected, that it's a farre eaſier thing to ſay we may be happily contented, and ſatisfyed in the want of theſe worldly advantages, then to be truly ſo indeed; and that the practiſe is farre more difficult then the profeſſion.\n\n\nAnſw. I confeſſe it is ſo, and that all have not learned that Divine Art: they muſt be diligent diſciples in the ſchool of Chriſt before they can take forth this leſſon, and become proficients: Nevertheleſſe if theſe particulars I have already inſiſted on, bewell conſidered, as the unſtable and momentany condition of all things here belowe, and how unſatisfying they are in their greateſt confluence and abundance; together with that exceeding danger that ariſes by an over-high eſtimation of them; and alſo the many and great diſtempers and diſtractions that attend both body and ſoul, in the fruition of them and parting with them; and likewiſe the terrour in accounting for them. Theſe with ſuch circumſtances and enlargements as our hearts will be ready to find out and ſuggeſt: will in ſome degree learne us how to want.\n            \n\n5. PARAGRAPH.\n               But in regard all are not thus qualifyed, I will endeavour to ſhew the difference betwixt thoſe that know how to diſpence with the want of creature-comforts, andthoſe that do not. The firſt ſort, are principally ſuch, as have learned to frame their mindes (with as much exactneſſe as may be) to their eſtates. All ſatisfaction and contentment ariſes from this very conjunction of ſuitables; a convenient with a convenient: he that hath never ſo va\n••\n an eſtate, if his heart be not framed to it, cannot be ſatisfyed. And on the other hand if his fortune be never ſo mean and poor; if his heart be ſuited to it, he's content, and enjoies himſelf with much felicity. That perſon knowes how to lack, that can ſpeak with the ſame faithful heart in Davids language,Pſal. 23.1.\nThe Lord is my Shepherd, and therefore can I lack nothing. And, that can alſo willingly imbrace that ſaving exhortation of this good King, in another place,Pſal. 34.9.\nO fear the Lord, ye that be his Saints; for they that fear Him lack nothing. It cannot be denyed, that many Servants of God enjoy but ſmall portions in this world, and may be reduced from a greater to a leſſe eſtate: but they conclude thatthe wiſe providence of God finds it good for them; therefore they will humbly ſubmit and ſubmiſſively ſtoop to that Divine Hand, and ſubject themſelves lowe at the feet of the Almighty, and with much patience endure what ever the Lord appoints them, and can withAct. 16.25.\nPaul and Silas, rejoice in their tribulation (if they be called to it.) Theſe know how to want, and nevertheleſſe faithfully rely upon that God which gave them a being, and walk conſcionably before him, truſting that he who is Lord of the whole earth, and the fulneſſe thereof, will not permit their carefull and pious endeavours to go weeping away; but will in his own due and appointed time, (when moſt agreeable to his Sacred Will) vouchſafe them a better being. O! What an happy eſtate have thoſe arrived at, that can improve miſery to ſuch an advantage? That become richer by their want, and better by their afflicton; & whoſe very infirmities afford them ſtrength? This ſeems ſtrange to fleſh and blood,and a carnal mind will be ready \n〈◊〉\n condemne it for an hereſy; yet neve\n•\n\ntheleſſe true with the children \n〈◊〉\n light, who are ſpiritually minde\n•\n that are ſo much the purer, in r\n•\n\ngard they have paſſed under the h\n•••\n\n of the refiner, and know how \n〈◊〉\n bleſſe God, and content themſelve in the loweſt condition. And ſuch doubtleſs have the greateſt Intereſt i\n•\n that incorruptible inheritance, that is laid up in heaven.\n               Now on the contrary, ſuch as a\n••\n unskilled in this art, of knowing wel how to want; are firſt thoſe who\n•\n indigence is accompanied with d\n•\n\nſtruſt. And though there be man gracious promiſes that hold fort\n•\n relief (or at leaſt ſupport) to tho\n••\n that are ſubjected to a mean condition; yet ſuch is their diffidence that they cannot endure to waite th\n•\n accompliſhment. If they receive n\n••\n ſupply in the very nick of time th\n••\n they expect it, they begin to deſpa\n••\n of ever obtaining any: ſo apt is depraved man to meaſure the merci\n••\n and diſpenſations of the Almightyby the crooked line of his own ſenſe, and by this means irritates the Ma\n\n•\neſty of the moſt High, rendring himſelf not only miſerable, but offenſive.\n               There is a ſecond ſort whoſe po\n\n•\nerty is clogg'd with envy, they ab\n\n•\norre to ſee any in a better condition\n\n•\nhen themſelves; it many times \n••\noubles them more then their own \n•\nant: ſuch is the nature of this baſe \n••\nſſion, that it extends not onely to \n〈◊〉\n\nhatred of others in reſpect of their \n••\ntward enjoyments; but alſo, of \n••\ne goodneſſe that is in them. An \n••\nvious perſon cannot endure to \n•\nhold one that makes more con\n\n••\nence of his courſe of life, then \n•••\nmſelf; or that hath a faire repute \n••\nongſt thoſe that are good; or that \n••\ndeavours to avoid thoſe ways that \n〈◊〉\n ſinful and deſtructive: eſpecially \n〈◊〉\n ſuch a man proſper and flouriſh, \n••\nin that raging monſter obſerves no \n••\nnds; but runnes into all the in\n\n•••\nrate exorbitances that may be, and \n〈◊〉\n qurrels with Divine Providence \n••\nlf, till he work his own ruine.\nThere is a third ſort whoſe \n〈◊〉\n is accompanied with Pride, \n〈◊〉\n though the very apprehenſio\n•\n that condition, ſhould be a m\n•••\n rather to humble them, then to \n〈◊〉\n up their hearts to ſuch a prep\n••\n rous Exceſſe; yet notwithſtand they often become guilty in \n〈◊〉\n caſe, and ſuffer their lofty \n〈◊〉\n to roave beyond their eſtates: of this number were theRev. 3.17. fo\n•\n\nLa\n•\ndiceans, that eſteemed them rich, encreaſed with goods, wanting nothing, when in truth were no better, then wretched miſerable, poor, and blind, a\n•••\n\nked. This proud conceit theEccleſ. 25.2.\n\n〈◊〉\n Man inveighes againſt as an al\n••\n\nnation.\nMoreover, there is another \n〈◊〉\n people, whoſe want is attend\n••\n abundance of impatience; by \n〈◊〉\n meanes they do not only ag\n•••\n their own affliction; but (that \n〈◊〉\n is more lamentable) they p\n•••\n and ſtirre up the diſpleaſure o\n••\n by a ſinful murmuring and re\n••\n at his all-wiſe dealing. Whe\n•\n\n\n〈◊〉\n\n\n••\nnſtead of gaining reliefe to themſelves, they add guilt to their miſery which will one day prove a greater \n••\nrrow to the ſoul, then the want of \n〈◊〉\n outward accommodations can \n••\nſſibly be to the body.\n               What a paſſionate humour (and \n•\nuch to be lamented) was that of \n••\ne Prophet Jonah; who being depri\n\n••\nd of the protection of that gourd, \n••\nich a few houres before had no \n••\ning; could, in the face of that God \n••\nich made both him and it, ſay,Joh. 4.9.\n\n\n••\no well to be angry, even to the death?\n\n•\neſe and many more, that I might \n••\nance in (ſhould I further run into \n••\nticulars) know not how to want, \n〈◊〉\n are ſo much the more miſerable \n••\nd ſo to be pittyed) by how much leſſe knowledge they have in this \n••\nſſary Divine Art. Thus if we \n••\nider and compare the particulars \n••\nnſiſted upon, both in reſpect of \n〈◊〉\n that know how to want, and \n〈◊〉\n that are ignorant thereof; we \n〈◊〉\n eaſily diſcerne the difference, ſee the vaſt diſproportion be\n\n••\nt them. The firſt are meek andhumble, the other are proud \n〈◊〉\n impatient; the ſouls of the firſt \n〈◊〉\n filled with love and confidence \n〈◊〉\n Gods mercies, the other are envin\n•\n and diffident; the one obſerves \n〈◊〉\n the diſpenſations of God with ſpiritual eye, the other lookes up\n••\n them with the eye of ſenſe; ſo \n〈◊〉\n there is as perfect antipathy \n〈◊〉\n twixt light and darkneſſe.\n               Therefore this ſhould engage \n〈◊〉\n through the aſſiſtance of Almig\n••\n God (whoſe help will never be \n•••\n\nnyed to thoſe that humbly \n〈◊〉\n faithfully implore it) to endea\n•\n by all meanes poſſible, ſo to b\n••\n and digeſt our wants, as that \n〈◊〉\n may neither indiſpoſe us to hi\n•\n\n\n••\n\ncred ſervice; nor diſturb our \n〈◊〉\n ſoules, and thereby ſhut us \n〈◊〉\n all hopes of that holy content\n•••\n which ſeaſons and ſweetens \n〈◊〉\n condition to us.\n\n\n6. PARAGRAPH.\n               CErtainly we cannot be careleſſe and negligent in this, if we con\n\n••\nider the Celeſtiall eſtate of thoſe that \n•\nive contentedly. If there be any \n〈◊〉\n appineſſe under the Sunne it muſt \n••\ne fixed here.\nFor firſt if we be freed from thoſe \n••\nxieties and diſturbances that all \n••\niſcontented perſons are lyable to, \n•\ne ſhall the better anſwer and mani\n\n••\nſt the end of our being, (which is \n〈◊〉\n ſerve our God in holyneſſe and \n••\nuth) we ſhall be inveſted with a \n••\nller capacity for that purpoſe. \n•\nnd that's a felicity, beyond which \n〈◊〉\n mortal can attain to in this life: \n••\nor he that is once ſettled in the \n••\nvice of his Maker, dreads not \n••\ne worſt of extremities, in reſpect \n〈◊〉\n any permanent miſery they can \n••\nduce him to: For ſo long as his \n••\nonverſation is above, what needshe be afraid of any croſſe acciden\n••\n here belowe, ſince all things work\n••\n together for the good of thoſe that fear God? Whatever ſtormes ari\n••\n he can anchor in a ſafe Harbour\n•\n Whatever adverſaries he me\n••\n with, he is ſufficiently armed again\n••\n them; for the Lord is his Shield an\n•\n\nBuckler, He's a preſent help in ti\n•••\n of trouble: and if occaſion be, \n〈◊〉\n hath a ſtrong Tower, a Rock of R\n•\n\nfuge, and a Caſtle of Defence to \n〈◊〉\n treat to, that will ſecure him in \n〈◊〉\n greateſt difficulty and danger.\n               Another Priviledge of thoſe th\n••\n live contentedly is, they comfort\n••••\n enjoy themſelves without wh\n•••\n (although a man poſſeſſe the w\n•••\n world) he's miſerable. That \n〈◊〉\n enjoyment is this, when a man \n〈◊〉\n peaceably and quietly attend, \n〈◊〉\n the ſervice of God, and his owne ling, without diſtraction, and \n〈◊〉\n comfortably apply himſelf to \n〈◊〉\n vocation that providence hath \n〈◊〉\n pointed him in his Pilgrimage. A\n••\n What doth it availe this Emper\n•••\n\n that Monarch, though their T\n•••\n\n\n•\nall Governments extend as farre as Land, and their commands reach the Seas, when they can never addreſſe themſelves to the managery of thoſe weighty affairs, that fall with\n\n•\nn the compaſſe of their Empires and Kingdomes without vexations and diſtracting diſturbances? Do they not meet with daily and hourly troubles? Sometimes they are threatned with Invaſions from without, inſurrections within, and diſcontents on every ſide; which diſ\n•\nurb their mindes in ſuch an high \n•\negree, that their powers become \n•\nrievous, and their Honours inſufferably burthenſome.\nFurthermore, that which addes to \n•\nhe excellency of contentation, It \n〈◊〉\n no where to be found, but with \n•\noſe that are truly Chriſtians not \n•\nominally but really: who ever elſe \n•\netendes to it, will find he hath but ſmall ſhare, if he examine himſelf \n〈◊〉\n a right rule. It's true, many Mo\n\n•\nll men may proceed far, and offer \n•\nir to this particular: yet if they be \n•\nought to the Teſte; It will be foundthey fall much below an holy co\n•\n\ntentation. St. Paul the Great \n〈◊〉\n of the Gentiles, could ſay after \n〈◊〉\n converſion (not before)Phil. 4.11, 12.\nI have lea\n•\n\ned in what ſtate ſoever I am in, ther\n•••\n to be content: I know how to be abaſe and how to abound. It was not th\n•\n learned Gamaliel, at whoſe feet \n〈◊〉\n ſate, that learned him that Ieſſo\n•\n he had not that Divine skill; no, \n〈◊〉\n was his Heavenly Maſter that taug\n••\n him this, and therefore he prof\n••\n\nſeth it. And hence may we kno\n•\n not only how to attain it, but a\n•••\n how to value it. And by how m\n••\n the more difficulty it is obtained, \n〈◊〉\n much the higher eſtimation we\n•\n engaged to ſet upon it; for if \n〈◊〉\n once arrive at this haven, we ha\n••\n taken a degree in Heaven, and the goodneſſe of our merciful Fa\n••\n know how to be happy both in \n〈◊〉\n and abundance. What a rare a\n••\n excellent advantage is this, when the midſt of troubles and comb\n•••\n\nons, how great, and of what na\n••\n ſoever they be, a Chriſtian can co\n••\n fortly acquieſce, and enjoy that \n〈◊〉\npeace within, which the world is not worthy of, nor hath any acquaintance with.\n               Though a man be otherwiſe never ſo well accompliſhed, never ſo exquiſitely learned (which I muſt confeſſe is highly commendable: and could the face of humane learning be preſented in its beauty, and made obvious to every eye; I am perſwaded it would almoſt raviſh every ſpectator;) yet without this inward ſoul-ſatisfying peace, all outward acquirements, and naturall endowments would prove empty and diſſatisfying. How nearly then it concernes us, as we tender our own ſatisfaction and comfort, as we regard the ſervice of our Heavenly Father, to ſend up our earneſt petitions to heaven, and to lay forth al our power and Intereſt for the purchaſing this precious Jewel, which in the worſt of times will be of ſingular advantage.\n\n\n\n7. PARAGRAPH.\n               IT's true, to quiet our ſelves in the contrariety of eſtates is difficult; yet by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirit, and the uſe of ſuch Sacred meanes as are appointed, it may be attained to. That which moſt oppoſes us in this work, is our querilous natures, that are hardly brought to know what they would have; and when they have it, are ignorant how to approve of it. Many would be happy; yet are extreamly unwilling to part from their houſes of clay: they love not to think of their diſſolution, (which is the beginning of true happiniſſe, to thoſe that have made their calling and election ſure.) They deſire to have their lives prolonged, and drawn out to a large term, yet are loath to endure the troubles, and the decayings incident to old age. They expreſſe a willingneſſeto be kept in order, and ſo to be made meet for their maſters uſe, yet cannot well digeſt the chaſtiſements of affliction. And thus in many inſtances of this kind, moſt men ſuffer a diſtraction in the contrariety of eſtates and conditions, and that in no ſmall meaſure, ſo long as perverſe nature is predominant: But if once Grace, (that ſpiritual habit of the ſoul) maſter and overcome that (otherwiſe untameable) monſter; (rebellious nature I mean) from thenceforth it becomes cowardly, unpowerful and dead, in reſpect of any prejudice it can poſſibly reduce us to. Let our condition be what it will, we ſhall be enabled to reſt ſatisfyed; which arrives us at ſome degree of perfection. Nevertheleſſe it muſt be acknowledged, that middle eſtate, or Golden mean, which the wiſe Monarch's thoughts ſeemed to pitch on, (when he deſiredProv. 30.8. neither poverty nor riches; but that he might be fed with the food of his meet allowance,) is in all rationall apprehenſion the beſt, and will moſtprobably avoid thoſe perturbing inconveniences that are incident to both extreames. For poverty, o\n•\n the one hand, (eſpecially if it m\n••\n with a man meerly natural) will deject him lower in his thoughts then the very earth that bears hi\n••\n and be apt to render him farre more deſp icable in his own eſteem, then the want of ſubſtance makes him poor. Nor doth it reſt here; but many times engageth him in a quarrell with his maker, and prompts him to fly in the face of heaven; becauſe he is not maſter of a larger portio\n•\n of earth: And to contemne the inexhauſtible Treaſures that are above, becauſe he wants a little tranſitory traſh here below; and thus at on\n••\n continues not only poor but offenſive.\n               So on the other hand, he that's gl\n••\n\nted, in riches, and wallowes in wealth and rather prey's then feeds on the fatneſſe of the earth, diſcovers a\n•\n much unquietnes in his eſtate, as thoſe that have but a skantling (compared with his fulnes.) Beſides his unlimitedand avaricious deſire importunes for more, and with the horſeleech, ſtill cries, Give, Give; ſeldome or never conſidering how he hath carried himſelf in his ſtewardſhip; nor regarding what pious improvement he ought to have made of ſo great a ſubſtance; nor minding that ſtrict account that will one day be exacted, for the whole carriage of his life, and eſpecially for the managing ſuch a large poſſeſſion. Alas! theſe things are too often exil'd from his thoughts, ſo that he growes imperious, and that carries him to a contempt of thoſe below him; but in the end (to his miſery) ſets him at a greater diſtance from true happineſſe. Thus both extreames are hazardous, unleſſe they meet with a gracious heart, that like a skilful Pilot, which way ſoever the wind blowes, can ſteer them to his advantage, and whenſoever ſtormes ariſe (though never ſo boiſterous and terrible) can provide for his own ſafety. How neceſſary is it then for all that reſpect their own happineſſe,by all induſtrious meanes to labou\n•\n and endeavour after this gracio\n••\n habit of the ſoul, that will rend\n••\n every condition placable, and eve\n••\n eſtate comfortable, without whi\n••\n we may only wiſh, but never, upon ſure grounds, hope for content, amongſt thoſe many croſſe traver\n•••\n and contrarieties of occaſion tha\n•\n the world pre\n•\nents us with? Th\n•\n wiſe Seaman, whoſe ſhip is toſſed \n〈◊〉\n the angry Ocean with furious an\n•\n irreſiſtible waves, will be ready t\n•\n feed the ſea with his fraught (though never ſo rich) by caſting it overboa\n••\n if he may thereby ſecure his own li\n••\n and his friends: Much more ought we, that are continually toſſed in the troubled ſea of this world, to caſt away all carnal affections and worldly deſires, and willingly ſuffer a deprivation of earthly endearments to preſerve that main neceſſary, (a gracious heart) which will prove of far greater moment then all outward Conſiderables.\n\n\n8. PARAGRAPH.\n               THis great advantage an holy heart furniſheth us withall. It ſeriouſly conſiders that Divine Providence orders and over-rules all Events. Whatever is done in heaven or earth, is obedience to it: not ſo much as an hair from our heads falleth, whereof God is ignorant: no tranſaction whatſoever, reſpecting our ſpiritual or temporal eſtate; but falls under the cognizance of the Almighty. That all-wiſe God meaſures out to every creature ſuch a due proportion: as he knowes will tend moſt eſſentially to his good: nor will he ſuffer any one child of his to want that, wherewith he ſhould be truly bettered in the enjoyment of it. Alas! Of our ſelves we are moſt prone to make choiſe of thoſe things that affect our ſenſe, and appear amiable and delighful at firſtview, though otherwiſe they ma\n•\n produce dangerous and deſtructiv\n•\n effects and conſequences. Wha\n•\n would become of us in this caſe, if Almighty God did not direct us and like a merciful Father, with a kind of Gentle compulſion, even force us to a reception and imbracement of thoſe better things, that have regard to the glory of his name and our own Eternall Welfare? \n〈◊〉\n our ſtation were not ſet us, we ſhould reſpect no bounds, obſerve no limi\n••\n\n but wander in thoſe waies that would deſtroy us.\n               There is no outward condition that can be univerſally good for all that which is healthful and nouriſhing meat for one, may prove a medicine to another. The Turk find food and Phyſick in that Opium, which would caſt one of us into our la\n••\n ſleep: ſhould the painful daily labourer, be confined to the Gentle mans dainty fare, it would either naucerate his ſtomach, or leave i\n•\n to quarrel for ſtronger proviſion. What one loves another diſlikestherefore providence furniſheth every one with that which is moſt fit for him; although perhaps not alwaies to our apprehenſion. There is not a creature in the world but is provided for by the Almighty: but we are altogether unfit to be our own Carvers, for that we know no meaſure. It is the Lord that lookes down from heaven (ſaies the Pſalmiſt) he beholds all the ſons of men; From the place of His habitation, He lookes upon all the inhabitants of the earth; and to thoſe whom He hath given a being, makes ſuch proviſion for, as is moſt agreeable to his wiſdome and their condition, and will, out of the aboundance of his love (in his own appointed \n••\nme) give them ſuch helpes, as may \n••\nnd to their better being. Certainly \n•\ne muſt betray a world of infidelity, \n〈◊〉\n we do not believe that God infinitely\n\n•\niſe doth know what is beſt for us, \n•\nho by his immenſe wiſedome hath \n••\nrmed the earth, and by his underſtanding hath eſtabliſhed the heavens;\n\n〈◊〉\n whoſe knowledge the depths arebroken up, and the clouds dro\n••\n down dew. Nor is his mercy le\n•••\n infinite to will what he knowes b\n•••\n for us: He opens his hand (ſait\n•\n\nDavid) and ſatisfyes the deſires \n〈◊〉\n every living thing; but eſpeciall\n•\n fulfils the deſires of them that fe\n••\n him, and graciouſly preſerves tho\n••\n that love him. His power is alſo in\n••\n\nnite to do what He wills: in whoſe rig\n••\n hand is length of daies, and in \n〈◊〉\n left hand riches and honour. Th\n•\n he that is ſteadfaſtly perſwaded \n〈◊〉\n that over-ruling power, and Sup\n••\n intendency, that Divine Provide\n•\n hath over all perſons and occaſio\n•\n cannot but be well ſatisfyed, \n〈◊〉\n ſubmit himſelf totally to the Lo\n••\n will; and in what condition ſoever he be, with Chriſtian wiſedo\n•\n and meekneſſe ſay, It's the Lo\n••\n dealing, let him do what he \n〈◊〉\n What croſs or calamity ſoever be\n••\n us in this life, is endured with m\n•\n more eaſineſſe, if we conſider \n〈◊〉\n Providence takes notice of it; an\n•\n it be for righteouſneſſe ſake, \n〈◊〉\n not only relieve us, but rewa\n••\nfor our ſufferings. Very rarely hath any. Child of God, fainted under affliction, that hath but ſeriouſly eyed Providence in its ſeveral diſpenſations, and faithfully endeavoured to make ſuch an holy uſe of them, as becomes thoſe that live under the Government of ſuch a ruling Majeſty. It's true, Gods waies are as farre above our waies, as heaven is above earth, and therefore are not ſo eaſie to be diſcerned by the ſonnes of men, yet a ſteadfaſt and well-grounded faith will very much ſupply our defects in this particular; and we may nevertheleſſe juſtly admire, what we cannot fully comprehend: and this may be taken for granted, that there is not any imaginable accident in the world, that befals thoſe that have an intereſt in God, but it hath a ſecret ſaving end in it, though it is not immediately made obvious to \n•\nhe eyes of thoſe it reſpects; nay, \n••\nough it carry never ſo ſeeming an \n•\nntipathy, as to their wills and pro\n\n•\nenſions. All men naturally deſire \n〈◊〉\n enjoy health, without which allother outward enjoyments have \n〈◊〉\n reliſh, yet, Sacred Providence ma\n••\n find that bodily ſickneſſe is eſſenti\n••\n to our ſouls health. Life is likewi\n••\n much eſteemed by us, but if He tha\n•\n gave it, hath appointed that nothin\n•\n leſs then death can render us glorious, ſure we ought to be well ſati\n•\n\nfyed. We cannot but betray a w\n•••\n of weakneſs, if we do not expreſs \n〈◊〉\n earneſt and real willingneſs, to pa\n••\n with a life, of a ſpan long (whi\n••\n for the moſt part is attended wi\n••\n trouble and grief) for that which full of bliſs to all eternity. Wha\n•\n ſoever the dealings of the Almigh\n••\n are, they ſhould have a ſanctify influence upon our hearts. An h\n••\n\nble and ſerious obſervation of eve\n•\n ſtep of Gods providence, will mu\n••\n improve our ſpiritual ſtock, and e\n•\n\nable us to bear any condition wi\n••\n comfort. Although our ſufferi\n••\n be of an high nature, and never\n••\n much aggravated by circumſtance\n••\n though our neereſt Relations ſhou\n••\n hold us in contempt, our famil\n••\n Friends ſhould deſpiſe us, and inſte\n••\nof lending us relief, (as much as in them lies) adde to the meaſure of our afflictions: and though all outward meanes, which we uſe for our own recovery deny us help, and utterly faile our expectation; yet the conſideration that God hath an hand in all this, and that by his wiſe Providence, he can reduce it to our good, and make us happy in the midſt of our unhappineſſe, will abundantly quiet our ſouls and engage us to look above all ſecond cauſes. Thus we ſee what a ſoveraigne remedy this is, againſt all diſaſters that may encounter us in this diſtracted world.\n            \n\n9. PARAGRAPH.\n               THere is no eſtate whatſoever, from whence we may not extract ſome advantage. Poverty is the leaſt deſirable of any, and yet from this (if it be not in the utmoſt extremity)much benefit may be reaped. The poor man that enjoies but little of the world, is firſt freed from thoſe terrible heart-breaking and ſoule-diſtracting fears, that frequently attend thoſe of the richer ſort, wh\n•\n many times ſuffer a deprivation o\n•\n their wits, out of an apprehenſion they have of parting with their ſubſtance, and ſo caſt themſelves into a deep degree of miſery; when th\n•\n poor man reſts quietly, and ſleep\n•\n ſecurely and ſeldome or never mee\n•\n with any ſuch terrours by day, \n〈◊〉\n affrightments by night. And the\n•\n again, he's free from thoſe ſolicito\n•\n and turmoiling cares that inſeparabl\n•\n wait on full eſtates.\n               He that hath riches upon the be termes that this life can allow, \n〈◊〉\n ſubject to many troubles and care\n•••\n ſollicitations about the due orde\n•\n\ning, and right managing of that ſto\n••\n\n which the Almighties bounty ha\n••\n furniſhed him withall. He conſide\n•\n that a great weight lies upon hi\n••\n and that an exact account of his \n〈◊〉\n haviour will one day be called fo\n••\nBut the troubles which follow wicked worldly men are inſufferably more grievous, thoſe are of a more perplexing and deſtroying nature, racking their joints and harazing every part, when the poor mans care is only to purchaſe ſo much with his paines and induſtry as may keep him honeſt, and in ſome ſmall meaſure maintain himſelf and his charge; and if at any time a better morſel be afforded to ſweeten his courſer fare, he ſits down exceedingly rejoiced, and ſends up as many or more hearty thanks to God, (the great Giver of all) as he that hath fed deliciouſly and feaſted on the choiſeſt diſhes all his daies. There is not the meaneſt mercy that an honeſt poor man meetes with, but he highly values, and raiſes it to a rich eſteem: when on the other hand, great mercies are very little or none at all regarded by thoſe that are worldly-minded and fatted up with the fulneſſe of the earth; ſo ſtrangely do the hearts and mindes of men become corrupted.\n               But to trace poverty a little farther,I have ſometimes taken occaſion to converſe with people of very poor and narrow fortunes (as to th\n•\n world) ſuch as indeed have looke\n•\n very neer an extremity. And I cannot but admire to think how abundantly well ſatisfyed they have been with their condition, and have expreſſe\n•\n more of ſpiritual worth, then thouſands that have moved in a far higher Orbe, (in reſpect of temporals.) Certainly this can be eſteemed \n〈◊〉\n leſſe then a very great benefit, whe\n•\n men ſo low in the eyes of the worl\n•\n live ſo high in the eies of their Maker, and it muſt be imputed to \n〈◊〉\n extraordinary goodneſſe of God, \n〈◊〉\n that he furniſheth them with ſu\n••\n proportionable ſupport, to ke\n••\n their ſpirits from fainting, and the\n••\n ſoules from ſinking in ſuch outwa\n••\n adverſe conditions. When gre\n••\n men hoiſt their top-ſail and laun\n••\n forth into the main, having the ſp\n•\n\ncious clew, which they ſpread, e\n•\n\npoſed to the violence of wind a\n••\n weather, the poor man ſailes n\n••\n the ſhore, and when an angry ſto\n••\nthreatens, puts into the next creek, and in a calme ſecurity wears out the extreamity of the Tempeſt, whileſt he obſerves prouder veſſels miſerably toſſed, and many times fatally wracked. Nor is it a ſmall benefit, that the poor man is freed from the peril of hateful contrivances and ſpiteful machinations, the Nimrods of the world think him too inconſiderable to take notice of; no man will ſharpen his axe to cut down ſuch a ſhrub: It is the lofty Cedars and large Timber of the world that have moſt cauſe to fear hewing. He fears not the danger of a fall that lies flat to the ground. Beſides it cannot but have a very cloſe reflection upon any ſpirit (though but morally ingenious) to trample upon thoſe, whom the Almighty hath already laid ſo lowe. Sure it is an high degree of aggravation, for any one to harbour a thought of adding miſery to thoſe, that are in any meaſure miſerable: and whoever becomes guilty of this; will one day be ſadly ſenſible of it. Chriſtian Prudence and compaſſionteaches this Leſſon, that wh\n••\n\never we ſee a Child of God under a\n•\n\nfliction, we ſhould be earneſt by \n〈◊〉\n poſſible meanes to adminiſter relie\n••\n and hold forth ſuccour: by this \n〈◊〉\n do not onely help the diſtreſſe\n•\n (which is great ſatisfaction) and \n〈◊〉\n imitate our Saviour, but alſo gain\n••\n further intereſt in the Father of mercies.\nAnother ſingular benefit that ariſe\n•\n\n to thoſe of a low and mean condition; is this, they have leſſe interruption and more freedome in thei\n•\n recourſe to heaven, then thoſe whic\n•\n are clogg'd with the incumbring cl\n••\n\n and mammon of the world. The po\n••\n\n man, his affections being not glue\n•\n to the things below, in his ſecre\n•\n addreſſes ſoares heaven-ward, an\n•\n there findes ſuch ineſtimable riche\n•\n as worldly men are not worthy of and though for the preſent he enjoy but in part; yet he is ſatisfyed of a fuller fruition hereafter when all creaed powers are diſſolved, and earthly advantages fled away. And then again, thoſe perſons that are accountedſo deſpicable here, cannot but receive a great ſupport from thoſe gracious promiſes which are recorded in Holy Writ, and do more imediately reſpect them then others. The poor and needy are pronounced bleſſed, and have aſſurance given that the Lord will deliver them in time of trouble. And though they ſhould be denyed the very crummes that fall from the rich mans table; yet hereafter to be happyed with ſuch a receptacle as Abraham's Boſome, muſt needs be accounted a full compenſation for all their ſufferings.\n            \n\n10. PARAGRAPH.\n               IN the next place, the better to beget a ſatisfaction, I would have all men ſeriouſly conſider, what a ſmall pittance will ſuffice nature; and certainly whatſoever exceeds that, is meerly matter of opinion. The Apoſtle Paul gives out this charge, that\n1 Tim. 6.9. having food and raiment we ſhould be therewith content. Nature car\n••\n for no more, then what may len\n•\n us nouriſhment, and hide our nakedneſſe; It's only our want on will that render us guilty of a faſtidion choiſe: and when they cannot attai\n••\n to that they rove after, then o\n••\n condition becomes implacable. Wha\n•\n a madneſſe is this in any perſon living to be both Author and promoter of his own diſturbance; to giv\n•\n ſo much way to a peeviſh perve\n••\n will, as to diſtract his whole courſe and make him not only a ſervant, \n〈◊〉\n a ſlave to its imperious tyrannical i\n•\n\ntruſions?\n               It would contribute much mo\n••\n to our ſatisfaction, if we laboure\n•\n to put a reſtraint upon our wills, tha\n•\n they run not into ſuch exorbitance\n•\n nor affect ſuch ſuperfluities. Ancient ſtories relate, that thoſe AN\n•\n CHORETS of old, that retire\n•\n into deſarts, and ſuſtained nature with the ſpareſt diet that thoſe place\n•\n could afford; lived longer then others, who uſually ſtifled themſelvewith a gluttonous variety. How often have we ſeen poor induſtrious people, whoſe fare hath been as hard as their labour, enabled with a greater meaſure both of health and ſtrength, then thoſe that have fed daintily, and lived as idly all their daies? If it were duely conſidered how pernitious an enemy Exceſſe is, and how deſtructive both to nature and grace; we ſhould rather decline it, then ſo vehemently thirſt after it; and learne to lymit our deſires within moderate bounds; and ſo we ſhould find mediocrity and eaſe. Extrems on all hands are not only dangerous, but deadly. And without doubt if we could but once reduce our mindes to a ſatisfaction in thoſe things which are onely neceſſary, and there acquieſce; our conditions would be farre more comfortable and well pleaſing both to our ſelves and others. For as one well obſerves, he is not rich that hath much, but he that deſires not much. And the beſt and trueſt meaſure of having or deſiring is not what we would,but what we ought: And if we we\n••\n\n\n•\nut brought to this rule, we ſhoul\n•\n\n\n•\ne ſo farre from being ſollicitoue i\n•\n the acquiring great things, that \n〈◊〉\n ſhould rather ſleight them; and a\n••\n count it much greater advantage \n〈◊〉\n enjoy a mean, then to ryot in abundance.\n               It is a moſt pernitious temper in any one to let his affections run after variety, when much leſſe may rationally ſuffice. It's only nature in in\n•\n depraved condition that hunts after novelty; and ſuch is our miſery that we want propenſion as well as power to reſtrain it. Therefore \n〈◊〉\n ſhould be our daily task to implore help from that Majeſty, that can with more eaſe give it, then we deſire it, whereby we may be inabled in ſome good meaſure to ſet limits to our craving mindes; that they may not hurry us on to ſuch a prodigious Exceſſe, which rather ſerves to encreaſe our trouble, then give quiet to our condition. When we obſerve a poor man (as the world accounts him) by his care and induſtry, ſoto husband and manage one ſmall patch or parcel of earth, as to raiſe thence proviſion for all his houſhold uſes, with meat and medicine, oile and honey; how can we with any face of reaſon or modeſty deſire to glut our ſelves with ſuch a confluence as would comfortably ſupport many? Certainly this is a crime of an higher conſequence, then we are apt to imagine, and ought to be overruled, before it grow too monſtrous; otherwiſe it will be very difficult to ſubdue. Let me adde one ſuppoſition more to this particular, and ſo leave it. Admit we had the actual poſſeſſion of as much as our deſires extend to, and were withall denyed hearts (which is the heavieſt curſe that can be) to diſpence it towards thoſe that are reduced to extream want; and ſuppoſe them to be ſuch, as may in many reſpects, deſerve better then our ſelves, and yet ready to periſh for want of ſuccour; Oh! then let's conſider what an inſufferable burthen this would be to a conſcience that is not ſear'd, toany heart that is not totally obdura\n••\n and hardened beyond all degrees \n〈◊〉\n ſenſe and commiſeration. Beſid\n•\n how formidable is it to conceive what a vaſt diſproportion this carries to the ſacred Will of the Almighty.\n               And how inconſiſtent it is, \n〈◊〉\n that courſe a Chriſtian ſhould obſerve; and how impoſſible it wi\n••\n be to give a juſt account at the la\n••\n and terrible day of Judgement, wh\n••\n a Summons ſhall iſſue from the high\n•\n Court of Heaven, to require all \n〈◊〉\n every corner of the World to attend before that Great TR\n•\n\nBƲNALL, and anſwer for a\n••\n things done and paſſed in their live\n•\n where every action that hath ſtept \n〈◊〉\n ſilence, ſhall be diſcovered, and th\n•\n ſecrets of all hearts laid open.\n\n\n11. PARAGRAPH.\n               FRom what I have ſaid appears, how little may ſuffice: beyond which, whatſoever we deſire, renders us guilty of the ſin of Exceſſe. Now it may be objected, that it is not ſo much the want of ſubſtance, as other croſſes and calamities, that diſturb and perplex the condition of \n•\nen in this life. To which I anſwer, that (however we conceive) afflictions are abſolutely neceſſary to thoſe \n•\nhat ſojourn in this Tabernacle of clay; \n•\nnd the very obſervation of God's \n•\niſpencing them will tend much to \n•\natisfaction. He does it ſo ſeaſona\n\n•\nly, and ſo intermixes them with \n•\nis Favours, that none but ill-natured children can grudge or repine at \n〈◊〉\n.Pſa. 103.9. He does not alwaies chide us \n•\nſaies the Pſalmiſt,) we have more \n••\niles then frounes from the beauti\n\n•••\n face of the Almighty. It was amoſt excellent anſwer, (and tha\n•\n which carryed a moſt high evidence of Chriſtianity) wherewith Patien\n•\n\nJob ſtopped the querulous mouth o\n•\n his impatient wife. What! (ſaith he)Job 2.10.\nſhall we receive good at the hand of God and ſhall we not receive evill? Suppoſe a man hath for the greateſt part \n〈◊〉\n his life enjoyed health (which is th\n•\n ſumme of earthly bleſſings) and towards his declenſion may be ſei\n••\n on with ſome afflicting malady \n〈◊〉\n diſtemper; ſhall this man add wra\n•\n to the meaſure of his miſery? O\n•\n no, let him rather kiſſe the rod, \n〈◊〉\n acknowledge all Gods dealings \n〈◊〉\n be juſt, and account it a mercy th\n•\n he hath been ſpared, till the eve\n•\n\ning of his age. The very corrupti\n••\n we brought with us into the wo\n••\n beſides thoſe daily actual enormi\n••\n whereof we are guilty, carry \n〈◊〉\n enough to reduce us to a conti\n••\n torment; ſo that we have very \n〈◊〉\n ground to bleſſe God for thoſe li\n••\n and ſhort afflictions we are ſubjec\n•\n to. For they are a ſpecial mea\n••\n to give us a better underſtandin\n•\nthat over-ruling hand, that wounds and heales, yea, even kills and cures at pleaſure. They learn us alſo more truly to know our ſelves, and to confeſſe that we are but clay in the hands of the Potter, who may faſhion and mould us as he pleaſeth; and make us veſſels of honour, or diſhonour, happy or miſerable, without the leaſt check to his juſtice, or prejudice to his Providence. Me thinks it's a great ſhame to Chriſtians, that they ſhould be leſſe ſenſible of Gods various actings and diſpenſations, then the very Heathens, who by the glimpſe of nature, and their own experience, could in ſome meaſure obſerve the change and intercourſe of the Almighties proceedings, and make ſome uſe of them.\n               It is ſtoryed of CAMILLƲS,\n\n•\nhat after he had upon a tedious ten \n•\nears ſiedge, taken the opulent City \n\n•\nEJOS; prayed that ſome miſ\n\n•\nortune might befall himſelfe and ROME, the better to qualifie and \n•\nemper ſo great an happineſſe.\nAnd ALEXANDER the Great,upon a Recount of thoſe wonder \n•••\n victories and high Atchievement wrought by his Armies, could c\n••\n to his JƲPITER, to intermi\n••\n ſome ill newes with that which wa\n•\n ſo happy. If ſuch men as theſe, coul\n•\n through their dark principles conclude it beſt, that bleſſings ſhould b\n•\n attended with croſſes; Then mud\n•\n more we, that have a fuller degre\n•\n of illumination.\n               Nor is it enough to endure croſſe patiently; but according to our Saviour's direction be ever ready t\n•\n take up the croſſe, and account \n〈◊〉\n our higheſt happineſſe when we ſuffer, eſpecially for the Teſtimony of CHRIST or a good conſcience.\nAfflictions (if they be not of a overpreſſing nature) are an Excelled meanes to keep the heart in order\n•\n and to provoke us to a more ſtri\n••\n and frequent courſe in our addreſſe to HEAVEN; where we ſhall me\n••\n with ſuch a glorious compenſation for all our ſuffering, as no heart \n〈◊〉\n able to conceive, nor tongue expreſsſuch a recompence (I ſay) to which all imaginary earthly felicities, cannot carry the leaſt equality or proportion. And that we may not doubt of this, the bleſſed Apoſtle St. Paul, directly aſſures us,2 Cor. 4.17. That our light affliction that is but for a moment, workes for us, a farre more exceeding, eternall weight of glory. I heartily wiſh that this expreſſion may be effectually thought on: for I never read any ſentence in Scripture fuller then this, or that carries ſuch efficacy and power in every word: A farre more exceeding, eternall weight of glory. Do but obſerve, how every word riſes a degree higher then other, till it come to the height of Eternity it ſelf. This is a ſingular comfort for Chriſtians, that though ſorrow and heavineſſe may ſeize on them for a night; yet joy comes in the morning, and continues with them for a longer term; which ought to engage every heart to over flowe with thankfulneſſe, and comfortably digeſt ſmall troubles, out of a lively ſenſe of future bleſſings.\n               __new_page_179225_52__\n\nWhy ſhould we murmur at pe\n••\n grievances, when the Author to th\n•\n\nHebrewes tells us,Heb. 2.10. the Captain \n〈◊〉\n our ſalvation, (Jeſus Chriſt) was \n〈◊〉\n perfect through ſufferings?\nHeb. 12.2. HE endure the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame for the joy that was ſet before HIM. And that we which were fettered i\n•\n chaines of iniquity, and bond-ſla\n••\n to ſinne and Satan, might be fre\n•\n from that thraldome, and delivere from deſtruction.\n\n\n12. PARAGRAPH.\n               FOr our further ſatisfaction, let conſider what worthy example we may meet with, that have be\n•\n content in their greateſt extremities Did not the Prophet\n1 Kings 17.6.15. &c.\nElijah receive \n〈◊〉\n food from Ravens, and after th\n•\n his meat from the poor widow \n〈◊〉\n\nSAREPTA? Were not an1 Kings 18.13. hundred men of the LORD'S Proph\n••\n\n (when Jeſehell endeavoured to \n〈◊〉\nthem) hid by fifty in a cave, and fed with bread and water? And was not a few barley loaves and ſmall fiſhes, a poor repaſt for our SAVIOƲRS Company, (which were four thouſand upon record?) And was it not hard for that glorious Apoſtle St. Paul, to apply his hands to Tent-making, to procure food for his belly? Yet in all theſe we do not find the leaſt repining, or any expreſſions of diſcontent.\nFurther let's fix our eyes upon the higheſt example that ever was, and that's the Eternall SON of GOD, Who took upon him the form of a Servant, and became poor that we might be made rich, ſuffered the moſt vile and ignominious death, that we might enjoy Everlaſting Life: HE that could command Heaven and Earth, and all the Treaſures and Precious things in them, that could by the word of HIS Mouth have erected the Statelyeſt Magnificent Palace, that ever any Earthly Monarch had, or any eyes beheld; yea he that could have brought down a\nCeleſtiall Tabernacle, and have pitched it here belowe, ſaies to the certain Scribe in St. Matthewes Goſpel,\nMat. 8.20.\nThe Foxes have holes, and the Birdes of the aite have neſts; but the SON of M\n••\n\n (meaning himſelf) hath not where \n〈◊〉\n lay his head. This did our bleſſed SAVIOƲR ſuffer, that our wants might be ſanctifyed to us, and that HE might learn us contentation in our loweſt condition.\n               If we caſt our eyes upon Men meerly morall, (whereof Hiſtory makes large mention) we may find to what an height they attained in this vertue, & how they have run away with great loſſes and extream poverty as inconſiderable ſleight burthens, and out of a willing choiſe have freely embraced thoſe conditions, which others that perhaps have been eſteemed more Chriſtian, have ſtartled at and endeavoured to avoid with much dreadfulneſſe. Do not we then deſerve to have this recorded to our utter ſhame, that PAGANS ſhould outſtrip us in thoſe practiſes that ſo neerly concern us? Do weobſerve an ARISTIPPƲS drowning his Gold in the Sea, that it may not drown him? And do we hear a DEMOCRITƲS confidently affirm, that the way to be rich, is to be poor in deſires, and can we forbear to wonder? What an admirable ſaying, was that of ONESICRITƲS, a very Indian? The earth is to me (ſaith he) as the mother to the child; for the mother ſupples her Infant with milke: ſo the earth yeelds me all neceſſaries. And when ALEXANDER the Great, would have given him Gold, Perſwade (ſaid he) if thou canſt theſe Birds to accept thy ſilver and Gold, that they may ſing the ſweeter; If thou canſt not do that, why ſhouldſt thou think me worſe then them? And further aſſerts, that our deſires as to riches and the like, proceed from the want on neſſe of our own wills, to which no boundes can be ſet, and not ſo much from any motion of Nature; and proves it by this ARGUMENT: Natural hunger when we have taken Food, ceaſeth. And if ourmindes did alſo naturally deſire GOLD, then ſo ſoon as w\n••\n had received it, our Appetites, \n〈◊〉\n to that, would preſently ceaſe; \n〈◊〉\n ſuch a diſtance are we from this Temper, that the more we have the more without intermiſſion w\n••\n inordinately crave, and thi\n••\n after.\n               This was an Excellent DISCOURSE, if we conſider it proceeding from an Heathen, and indeed ſuch as might very well become a CHRISTIAN. Hence I paſſionately wiſh, that all (but eſpecially thoſe that make a Profeſſion of HOLYNESSE) would abhorre to fix their ſole affections, upon ſuch worthleſſe tranſitory things; and be convinced ho\n•\n unſatisfying they are, and learn to entertain afflictions with joy.\n\n\n13. PARAGRAPH.\n               HAving now runne through moſt of thoſe Grievances and perplexities, that are apt to diſtract us in our lives, and alſo taken notice how fraile and fading all ſublunary things are: And likewiſe having endeavoured to raiſe ſome matter for ſatisfaction in our deepeſt exigences, from the conſideration of thoſe nobler things, that are of a more durable and heavenly concernment: I ſhall next ſurvey that condition which of all other ſeemes moſt terrible, and is therefore termed the KING of Fear, and that is Death it ſelf, whoſe very name is attended with trembling; in reſpect of which all the afflictive incidences of mans life, carry little or no proportion. And ſo it is indeed more formidable then I can expreſſe, to thoſe that have not ſome aſſuranceof a better life, that are not furniſhed with ſpiritual Armour for this laſt encounter. But I ſhall make it appear, it's much otherwiſe to thoſe that have an intereſt in CHRIST; who conſider the unavoidable neceſſity of it; grounded upon that unalterable Eternal Decree of Heaven; And, thatHeb. 9.27.\nall men are appointed once to dy. They are ſo farre from deſiring an exemption from that condition, that they are ſaid in Scripture to wait and long for it. There are two eſpecial daies, for which the Children of GOD are ſaid to wait.\n               The firſt is the day of death, wherein they go to the LORD.\nThe ſecond is the day of appearing, wherein the LORD ſhall come to them.\nThey ſojourne in the body, more weary of it, then David was of his dwelling in the Tents of KEDAR; they waite with patientJob 14.14.\nJob, till the day of their change come, and deſire with the Apoſtle to bePhil. 1.23. diſſolved and be with CHRIST; yeathey pray for it, ſo often as they mention that petition:Mat. 6.10. & Lu. 11.3.\nLet thy Kingdome come. They labour after death, ſo far, as it may be a meanes to aboliſh ſin, that CHRIST their KING may alone reign in, and over them. It is nevertheleſſe true, that wicked and irreligious perſons, put the remembrance of death far from them; yet for all that it comes upon them ſuddenly, as2 Kings 23.24.\nJehu furiouſly came upon Jehoram, though they run to their Chariots, (that is) their Refuges of vanity; Death's dart ſurely overtakes them. But the good Iſraelites of GOD deſire to be ever prepared, with theirExod. 12.11. loines girded, and their ſtaves in their hands, ready to take their journey from EGYPT to CANAAN, whenſoever the Majeſty of the Moſt High GOD ſhall command them. As fowles deſirous to fly, ſtretch forth their wings; ſo do theſe extend their affections towards HEAVEN.\n               \nGen. 18.1.\nAbraham ſate in the dore of his Tabernacle, when the Angell appeared to him;1 Kings 19.9.\nElias came out tothe mouth of his Cave, when the LORD appeared to him: ſo ſhould we rejoice and be glad to come o\n••\n of the Cave and Tabernacle of th\n••\n wretched body, that we may me\n••\n with the LORD of Glory. This Meſſenger (DEATH) cures all our Maladies, and reſcues us from all our fears and dangers; This is that Cherub, that ſtands Centinell at the Gate of Paradiſe: There's no entrance but under his hand. There\n•\n no paſſage to thoſe glories above, but through the Gates of Death here below.\n               But that which renders death yet more deſirous to the Godly, is the ſecond day (which they are ſaid to wait for.) And that's CHRISTS ſecond coming. The Apoſtle gives this as a Token of the rich Grace of GOD, beſtowed on the Gorinthians,\n1 Cor. 1.7.\nthat they waited for the appearance of CHRIST, yea he gives it out as a mark of all thoſe that ſhall be glorifyed, when he ſaies,2 Tim. 4.8.\nThere is laid up for me a Crowne of Righteouſneſſe, and not for me only; but all thoſe, that loveChriſts ſecond appearing. And again,Heb. 9.28.\nCHRIST was offered to take away the ſins of Many; and unto them that look for HIM, ſhall HE appear without ſin unto ſalvation. Amongſt the Jewes as the day ofLev. 25.10.\nJubilee drew nigh: ſo the joy of thoſe that were in priſon encreaſed; for that it brought them an aſſurance of relief. Much more cauſe have we to rejoice, the neerer the day of our Eternall Jubilee approaches, when all teares ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and ſorrow and mourning ſhall fly away for ever.\nBut to encounter a little further with this great Combatant; firſt I ſay, that Death which the righteous ſuffer, is not total; for it can never ſtrike the whole man; but onely the weakeſt part, his body: the more excellent part, the ſoul, is partaker of Eternal Life.\nNor ſecondly is it perpetual; for our ſoules ſhall not abide under the Bonds of Death: the ſpirit of Chriſt that dwells in us, ſhall raiſe us up, and cloath us with Immortality.There is begun in the Children \n〈◊〉\n Light, a life, which no death is eve\n•\n able to exſtinguiſh; though it ma\n•\n invade the vital, natural powers \n〈◊〉\n the body, and ſuppreſs them one after another, and at laſt break in upon this lodging of clay, and demoliſh it to the ground; yet that man \n〈◊〉\n GOD which dwells in the Body, ſhall eſcape with his life. Though the Tabernacle is caſt down, (which is the worſt our enemy can do) ye\n•\n he that dwelt in it is removed to better. As the Bird eſcapes out o\n•\n the ſnare of the Fowler: ſo the ſoul i\n•\n\ndeath flies away with joy to her Maker The diſſolving of the body, to the Children of GOD is but the unfolding of the net, and breaking open the Priſon wherein they have been detained, that ſo they may be delivered from that Captivity. Here's comfort in abundance, for all thoſe, whoſe conſciences can give evidence of their well-led lives. And for thoſe alſo whoſe peace is made with GOD through CHRIST, by meanes of thoſe two powerful Mediatours,ſteadfaſt faith, and unfained repentance.\n               The Apoſtle Paul in his Epiſtle to the Romanes, gives us this aſſurance,Ro. 5.1.\nThat being Juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; The efficacy of whoſe death effectually applyed to our ſouls, will ſufficiently ſeaſon and ſanctify death unto us. For how can we poſſibly fear that enemy, whom our Redeemer hath already conquered? As in the battel betwixt ourGen. 3. Saviour and Satan, Satan's head was bruiſed, and he did no more then tread on the heele of our Saviour, ſo ſhall it be in the conflict of all his members. By the power of the Lord Jeſus, we ſhall be more then Conquerours. TheRo. 16.20.\nGod of our peace ſhall tread downe Satan under our feet: There is a ſeed of immortal life in our ſoules, which no power of the Enemy is ever able to overcome. So ſoon as we lanch forth of this life, we arrive at the bleſſed Haven of everlaſting happyneſſe, where there is a Glory for all thoſe that are heires of the Promiſe,which is both infinite, and incomprehenſible.\n            \n\n14. PARAGRAPH.\n               THus I have in ſome meaſure made it evident, how advantageous the day of diſſolution is to the Children of God; and therefore cannot but wonder, how any, upon ſolid grounds, can deſire a continuance in this valley of tears; eſpecially, if they conſider alſo the many miſeries and inconveniencies, that a\n•\n incident both to ſoul and body i\n•\n this life, and the irreconcileable enmity that is betwixt them in the\n•\n Conjunction; As the Apoſtle Paul of ſerves in his Epiſtle to the Galation\nGal. 5.17.\nThe fleſh luſts againſt the ſpirit, and \n〈◊〉\n ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe \n〈◊〉\n contrary one to the other, ſo that \n〈◊〉\n cannot do the things we would ſuch and ſo many continued jarr\n••\n are betwixt them, that they are ev\n••\nprone to exhibit Articles of impeachment againſt each other. The ſoul it complaines of that Original guilt and corruption, which was tranſlated upon humane nature, through Adams tranſgreſſion, wherewith it was not tainted, nor defiled, as it came only from the Immaculate hands of its pure Creator. And then again, the ſoul ſaies, had it been ſingle without this earthly Partner, it had never had that propenſion to ſin, nor that inclination to rebellious actings againſt the Majeſty of Heaven; nor that averſnes and indiſpoſition to good; Nor had its underſtanding (as to thoſe ſpiritual things which pertain to God) been ſo eclipſed and benighted at the noon-day of ſuch Glorious Diſpenſations; Nor had it been lyable to ſuch diſtracting cares, and ſuch diſcompoſing paſſions, which bring forth ſtormes and terrible Tempeſts that dayly threaten its ruine and deſtruction.\n               Theſe & ſuch like complaints hath the ſoul againſt the body, the ſpirit againſt the fleſh. There is amongſt manymore, another particular which we have juſt cauſe to reſent with much reluctancy.\n               This burden of fleſh, this houſe of clay retards our glory, and for a time, ſecludes us from our Celeſtiall Manſion.2 Co. 5.1. & 6.\nFor we know (ſaies that Great Apoſtle) that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of GOD, an houſe not made with hands, eternall in the Heavens. And a little after that, ſaies, While we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord; from that Lord which inhabites that Celeſtiall houſe (before mentioned) to all eternity. O! Of what excellent uſe it would be, if we ſeriouſly conſidered that word ETERNITY! It is of that extent, that no men, nor Angels, are able to expreſſe, being ſo farre beyond the reach of all conception. For if all men in the world were exact Arithmeticeans, and were imploied all their lives to adde number to number, and multiply years, the product of all their labours, and the total ſumme of all their Accounts(in reſpect of time) would not carry the leaſt proportion to ETERNITY. Or if the mighty maſſe of whole earth, were contracted into one heap, & all that tranſlated into ſuch ſand as lies by the ſea-ſhore, one ſingle ſmall Bird would remove it all, grain by grain, before ETERNITY lookes towards an end.\n               Having already taken notice of thoſe diſadvantages, that unavoidably attend us, during the time that our ſouls and bodies are conjoined, that is, our pilgrimage in this world: We have ſo little cauſe to keep our deſires at a diſtance from our diſſolution (eſpecially if we have any comfortable aſſurance of an intereſt in heaven) that on the contrary, we may juſtly rejoice, when that day approaches, and the houre drawes nigh, wherein we ſhall be happily freed, not onely from the guilt, but alſo (which to a good ſoul is fingular comfort) the temptations and occaſions of ſinne. Then ſhall that interpoſing veile, be either made tranſparent, or drawn quite fromour eyes, that we may with clearneſſe and perſpicuity diſcern the glorious ſunſhine of God's favour, and paſſe under the tender appellation of dear Children; andRom. 8.17.\nif children, then heires, heires of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt, being freed from the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, and filled with the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.\n\n\n15. PARAGRAPH.\n               ANd that we may be capable of ſuch a Celeſtiall Eſtate, It concernes us firſt to be truly humble, to harbour a mean eſteem of our ſelves and to ſet a rich value upon every mercy we receive; and let the leat mercy (which is more then we deſerve) be an engagement upon our ſoules to walke in a more conſtant courſe of Holyneſſe, to the Glory o\n•\n HIM that is the Author of all ou\n•\ngood. That ſpirit is far from Chriſtian, that ſtands upon termes with his maker, that dare look upon the leaſt bleſſing with a diſdainful aſpect, or upon the greateſt croſſe with indignation. It is an humble ſoul and a meek ſpirit that are highly acceptable to God, and where theſe dwell, Grace ever attends them, and that in a full meaſure.\n               He that hath a ſenſe of his own unworthyneſſe, and conſiders ſinne as it offends the mercifull God of Heaven; lookes upon every exemption from evil, as a mighty mercy, and every chaſtiſement for ſinne as a bleſſing. And if precept will not engage us to be humble; we have the moſt powerful and prevailing example, that ever was expoſed to imitation, and that's our Saviour Chriſt; with what abundance of humility HE endured all HIS ſuffering, Holy Writ makes plentiful mention. Who then would not be willing to tread in his Saviours ſteps, as knowing that it is the ſureſt way to glory? He that humbles himſelf ſhall undoubtedlybe exalted, as in the General Epiſtle of St. James:\nJam. 4.10.\nHumble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and HE ſhall lift you up. And again, God reſiſts the proud and gives grace to the humble.\nAnd that which will further conduce to our happineſſe, is a ſtate of ſelf-reſignation. He that in the midſt of all adverſe conditions, can caſt himſelfe into the hands of his God, ſhall not faile to find ſupport and comfort. HE beſt knowes how to diſpoſe of us. Natural men in their exigences are prone to make application, and have recourſe to thoſe which have greater Authority and power then themſelves, though they have no aſſurance of relief from them: but certainly they have no ſenſe of their own happineſſe, that will not truſt themſelves with the Lord, who does not only allow; but ſollicit their relyance on him: Witneſſe that Text in the Epiſtle to the Philippians,\nPhi. 4.6.\nBe careful (ſaies the ſpirit of God) for nothing; but in every thing by prayer, and ſupplication, withthankſgiving, let your requeſts be made known unto God. There is no affliction can poſſibly ſeize on us, whereof our heavenly Father takes not ſtrict notice, and weighs every dramme thereof, in the ſcale of his Divine Providence (which I have before more particularly inſiſted on) which conſideration alone is ſufficient to preſerve our ſpirits from ſinking. He that can ſteadfaſtly believe, needs not fear; for he ſhall have deliverance, in the greateſt extreamity. And as the Author to the Hebrewes obſerves,He. 11.1.\nFaith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen. It's that by which deliverance ſubſiſts, in the womb or in the bowels of the promiſe, before it be brought forth for our reliefe and ſuccour. He that upon Chriſtian grounds caſts his care upon God, \n•\nhall never loſe his reward. That ſpirit ſhall not want ſupport in the proſſeſt occurences. It is not the \n•\nevereſt perſecution of our enemies; nor the ſad deſertion of our Friends and humane confidence; nor diſconſolatecaptivity; nor wandrin\n•\n baniſhment; nor pale-faced ſickneſſ\n•\n nor the deprivation of all earth endearments, that can ſet us at a l\n••\n with our God,Pſal. 68.20. if we truſt in him; \n〈◊〉\n\nhath the iſſues of death in his band, & h\n•\n faithfully promiſed thatHe. 13.5. HE \n〈◊〉\n never leave us, nor forſake us, b\n•\n compaſs us with his everlaſting kindneſſe, and who will convert our dark eſt night into chearful day, and e\n••\n greateſt ſorrow into refreſhing joy Moreover if we can by faith ma\n•\n Chriſt ours, we ſhall purchaſe tha\n•\n whereof the world is not worthy but though I ſaid purchaſe, it ſha\n••\n be without price, according to th\n•\n remarkable place in the Propheſy \n〈◊〉\n\nIſaiah, that glorious invitation \n〈◊〉\n all thoſe that long after Chriſt, th\n••\n\nIſa. 55.1.\nHo, every one that thirſteth, come ye\n•\n the waters, and he that hath no money come ye, buy and eate; yea, come, buy wi\n•\n and milk without money and without pri\n••\n\n If we take this in a ſpiritual ſenſ\n•\n we ſhall find that Jeſus Chriſt is a\n••\n in all. HE is food, rayment, health\n•\n liberty, protection, preſervationdirection, proviſion,1 Cor. 1.30.\nWiſdome, ſtrength, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, redemption and ſalvation unto life. HE heales all our wounds, binds up all our breaches, cures all our maladies, and by the effectual power of HIS ſpirit, crucifies our luſts, regulates our wild affections, kills our baſe corruptions, and through his mercy, reſtrains us from thoſe nefarious actings, and rebellious courſes, to which our defiled natures prompt us. HE is that true riches in reſpect of which all the riches of the world, are but contemptible droſſe, and carry no compariſon. The Heavens are His babitation, the Earth is His foot ſtool, and He ſits on that Celeſtiall Throne with His Father, and there reſerves ſeats for all thoſe that have an intereſt in him, to be everliving partners of his Glory. Who then would not lay out all his ſtock to purchaſe this Pearl, ſpend all his time, extend all his endeavours, and apply himſelf to the uſe of all poſſible meanes, to arrive at this Haven of happyneſſe, and become partakerof this Everlaſting Bliſſe?\n            \n\n16. PARAGRAPH.\n               THen let the conſideration of th\n•\n Glory hereafter, carry us on t\n•\n an holy and reſolved acquieſcency i\n•\n that condition that our heaven\n•\n Father appoints us in this life, \n•\n\nſteeming it of all other the beſt. A\n••\n we lowe? Let not our envy fee on thoſe that are advanced to a\n•\n higher pitch. Are we exalted? Let in no meaſure contemne thoſe tha\n•\n live in a meaner ſtate. Are we ſick \n〈◊〉\n Let's not quarrel with the Phyſitia\n•\n\n Are we in health? Let's not abuſ\n•\n it. Are we in outward diſtreſs? Let'\n•\n patiently look up to him, that b\n•\n his Providence orders all Event\n•\n Let our wils and underſtandings render an abſolute ſubmiſſion to his m\n••\n Sacred Will. We have no power a\n•\n all to determine what is fitteſt for u\n•\n in our Pilgrimage. Fleſh and blou\n•\nare the moſt incompetent Judges in \n••\ne world, as to that particular. It \n〈◊〉\n onely the infinite wiſdome of the \n•\nreat Arbiter of the univerſe, that \n•\nn beſt allot us our portions. He \n•\nely knowes how, where and when \n〈◊〉\n diſpence ſavours and inflict pu\n\n•\nſhments. His heavenly will is the \n•\noſt abſolute rule of juſtice. We \n•\nave not the leaſt cauſe to complain, \n〈◊〉\n our outward Man ſuffer ſome cha\n\n•\nſement, ſo that the Inner Man may \n〈◊〉\n more throughly renewed. But \n•\nas! Such is the temper of ſome \n•\nen, that if they enjoy all they wiſh \n•\nr, they would be thence tranſport\n\n•\n to ſuch an imperious height of \n\n•\nride and Prodigious Impiety, that the \n•\nry earth would groan to beare \n•\nen; ſome there are likewiſe, that \n〈◊〉\n they endured ſuch an heavy mea\n\n•\nre of affliction as others, would \n•\now irrecoverably deſperate. In this \n•\nerefore, doth the great wiſdome and \n\n•\nercy of God eminently appear, that he \n〈◊〉\n every man with ſuch a condition, \n〈◊〉\n is moſt agreeable and contributory \n〈◊〉\n the advancement of his Glory,and their own Good. And thou\n•\n by reaſon of that thick darkneſſe \n〈◊〉\n our underſtandings and the dimne\n•\n of our apprehenſions, we cannot \n〈◊〉\n perſpicuouſly diſcern theſe vario\n•\n dealings and diſtributions of the A\n•\n mighty; yet ſuch they are, & do ſtri\n•\n\nly challenge our ſerious obſerva\n•\n\nons; and whoever is negligent he\n•\n in, betraies not only his groſſe i\n•\n\nnorance, but hateful ingratitu\n•\n\nWhen on the other hand, he th\n•\n diligently eyes the diverſity of d\n•\n penſations, and with his whole he\n•\n faithfully and ſavingly intends th\n•\n hath already attained to a good in\n•\n provement.\nTherefore let not our wills, b\n•\n God's be done; there was never a\n•\n man unhappy, that was contented diſpoſed to be what God would ha\n•\n him.\n\n\n17. PARAGRAPH.\n               THere is another particular very neceſſary to be reſolved on; that is, an abatement of our deſires, as to earthly things, eſpecially in ſuch a juncture of time as this is; When the Captain General of heaven and earth, is in ſo deep a conteſt with the whole world, and threatens to daſh in pieces all ſublunary powers; how farre his Divine judgements have already reached, experience in ſome meaſure tells us; And how Epidemical that ſtroke may be, is beyond our capacity to determine; Every day producing new pleadings, and controverſies betwixt God and the world; in ſo much that the foundation thereof ſhakes, and all the dominions therof, ſeem to have the mark of ruine ſtamped in their aſpects; and the Lord knowes how ſoon (for our rebellions againſt heaven havelong ſince cryed out for vengeanc\n•\n it may be caſt into a general conf\n••\n gration; ſo that it's palpably evide\n••\n we are even now caſt upon the ve\n•\n point or criſis of deliverance, or d\n•\n ſtruction.\n               All this being conſidered, we ha\n•\n little reaſon to advance our deſire (touching temporals) to ſuch a ſh\n••\n pendious height; but rather wi\n••\n Chriſtian diſcretion ſet down the\n••\n poſitive bounds, and ſay as the Almighty ſaid to the Sea,Job 38.11.\nHither to ſh\n•\n you come and no further, and here ſh\n•\n your proud waves be ſtaid. Let's in th\n•\n manner give check to our ambition thoughts, that they may not rove a\n•\n ſuch a prodigious rate. For I a\n•\n perſwaded, could the vaſt deſires \n〈◊〉\n ſome take effect, ſo exorbitant th\n•\n are, that if poſſible, they would en\n•\n ſlave the whole world. Be more the\n•\n the ſea, which though a raging element, is confin'd within his limits More then the heavens which neve\n•\n paſſe their circumference: yea mor\n•\n then the Sunne, which never travel\n•\n beyond the ecliptick. But ſure w\n•\nought to be much otherwiſe minded, and ſtrive to be of St. Pauls temper, who (as one well obſerves) was the richeſt poor man that ever lived, as having all things, yet poſſeſſing nothing. We have it from good Authority, that there is neither ſafety, nor true pleaſure in Exceſs, (as I have formerly expreſſed.) Too much is troubleſome; what a clogge was to SARENA a Parthian Lord, (whereof Hiſtory takes notice) that could never remove his family, with leſſe \n•\nhen a thouſand Camels? Satisfaction doth not conſiſt in abundance; for a ſuperfluity both of profits and pleaſures, hath commonly a very ill influence upon the mind, and is apt \n•\no reduce it to a ſtrange kind of debauchery and inſatiableneſſe. Too \n•\narge a quantity of meat (though Good) doth as ordinarily offend \n〈◊〉\n weak ſtomach, as that which is \n•\noth unſavory and unwholeſome. \n•\nome Appetites are ſooner wearyed, \n•\nen ſatisfyed. He that feeds ſpaingly, for the moſt part, is in a bet\n\n••\nr ſtate of health, then he that feed\n•\nmuch; for the latter often gluts a\n••\n over-charges nature, ſo that inſte\n••\n of receiving nouriſhment, ſhe beco\n••\n diſtempered, and runnes forth in\n•\n diſeaſes. This holds a direct par\n••\n\nlel with the deſires of men, as \n〈◊〉\n other earthly enjoyments. Therefore it juſtly concernes us, to gi\n••\n ſtrict and ſevere repulſes to the f\n•••\n overtures and appearances of inordinate deſires, and to curb the u\n•\n\nruly motions of our hearts in th\n••\n very infancy, otherwiſe they \n•••\n grow too ſtrong and incorrigib\n••\n and ſo carry us on to a wild Exce\n••\n which is not onely dangerous \n•••\n deſtructive. But as to ſpiritual thi\n••\n our deſires can never be inordina\n••\n our thirſtings and longings a\n••••\n Grace and holyneſſe, is that ſacri\n•••\n which of all other, is moſt pleaſ\n•••\n to God, and moſt benificial to \n〈◊〉\n own immortal ſoules. This \n〈◊〉\n ſtand us inſtead when all tranſit\n•••\n traſh, and vain delights vaniſh. \n〈◊〉\n will be a meanes not only to ſuppo\n••\n us here, but rejoice us hereafter. A\n••\n laſtly, we have the greater cauſe,contract and limit our deſires in earthly things, for that the guilt of miſinjoying them, will attend us with ſorrow to our graves, and after that to the judgement-ſeat, that Great Tribunall.\n\n\n18. PARAGRAPH.\n               THerefore ſince it is neceſſary, that Nature be kept ſhort of her Demands: Let's reſolve firſt to deny her \n•\nmall things, and ſo by degrees we \n•\nhall be able to overcome her in that wherein otherwiſe ſhe would grow impetuouſly violent, and leſſe lya\n\n•\ne to ſubduction, (but obſerve I \n•\neak of her here in a depraved con\n\n•\ntion.) We ſhall be in a farre better \n•\npacity to encounter with great \n••\nflictions, if we exerciſe our ſelves \n•\nith digeſting ſmall croſſes. He that \n••\nath a diſtempered ſtate of body, and \n••\npplyes himſelf to the advice of his \n\n••\nyſitian, will firſt take a preparative, beforea ſtrong Potion. It is requiſite \n〈◊〉\n ſhould obſerve the ſame courſe with the troubles that ſeize upon the min\n•\n petty grievances are endured wi\n••\n more eaſe, and open a way for o\n••\n patience and further ſupport, under thoſe of a more preſſing nature. \n〈◊〉\n that will not ſuffer a check, nor \n••\n\nceive a frown, will hardly take \n〈◊〉\n blowe, but retort it with vehemen\n••\n. Nor will he endure the violence of tempeſtuous ſtorm, that will not \n〈◊〉\n bide a little wet. Thoſe that ha\n••\n lived long in proſperity, and ha\n••\n been thence tranſported to the t\n••\n of worldly pleaſure, ſeldome or \n••\n\nver meeting with the leaſt guſt, \n〈◊〉\n counter-blaſt of adverſity; If af\n••\n all this, Providence ſurprize the\n••\n with ſome anxious ſharpe affliction Oh! How it preſſeth them down \n〈◊〉\n the earth; and (unleſſe they be w\n••\n principled) diſtracts all their fac\n••\n\nties, workes a ſtrange diſcompoſu\n••\n in all their thoughts, deſtroies \n〈◊〉\n their joy, and hurries them to a de\n••\n degree of impatience; and ſo e\n•\n\ngages them to quarrel with that i\n••\nreſiſtible Divine hand that ſtrikes; whereby they adde offence to their miſery. And much of this may be imputed to their non-acquaintance with former ſufferings. He that can diſcover a calme contented temper, when his friends and intimates faile him, his dear relations diſapoint him in thoſe things wherein he promiſed himſelf a ſatisfaction: If he can paſſe over theſe and ſuch like occurrences, ſo as not to be paſſionately concerned; certainly this man will be in a comfortable capacity to entertain croſſes of an heaviour conſequence.\n               I have obſerved, thoſe that deſire to have their Children ſtrong and active, as a means conduceable thereunto; have inured them to pitch barres, to toſſe ponderous weights, to handle foiles, and the like; which ſerves both to extend and ſtrengthen the Nerves, and gives an aptitude to exerciſes of that nature. Truly, it is not unworthy our imitation in the courſe of our lives; for if we acquaint our ſelves with a patientbearing of thoſe leſſer croſſe incidences, that unavoidably attend \n〈◊〉\n in our Pilgrimage; we ſhall have \n〈◊〉\n greater power to deale with, and more Chriſtian fortitude to ove\n•\n rule, the diſtracting influences of th\n•\n ſevereſt troubles.\n               It was an excellent uſe (and wor\n••\n our obſervation,) that Socrates ma\n••\n of the ſharp tongues of his wives, f\n••\n (ſaid he) They prepare my patience \n〈◊〉\n publique ſufferings. It will very mu\n••\n availe us in this particular, if \n〈◊〉\n thwart our novile wanton appetit\n•\n in thoſe things wherein they pla\n••\n ſo much pleaſure, and do curb our \n••\n\nrioſity with a delatory forbeara\n••\n of thoſe ſeeming contentment which we ſo fondly affect. Do va\n••\n (though pleaſurable) delights pro\n•\n\n us to embrace them? Let's de\n••\n our ſelves the liberty of compliance though they earneſtly importune \n〈◊〉\n Let's not gratify our curious hum\n••\n\n with the taſte of thoſe endearing n\n•\n\nvelties, that meet us with ſuch in\n••\n\nnuating invitations. We have \n〈◊〉\n very memorable Example in Dav\n••\n\nand that which argued a Rare Regiment of his paſſions; That when he was in extremity of thirſt, and longed for refreſhment, could ſay,2 Sma 23.15.16.17.\nOh! that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the Gate! But when he perceived that water was purchaſed with the hazard of the lives, of three of his mighty men, which ruſhed through the Army of the Philiſtines to drawe it at the well; being brought unto him, he would not drinke it; but (ſaies the Text) poured it unto the Lord. This was a ſingular peece of ſelf-denyal in that Good King, to reject the benefit of that he ſo exceedingly defired, in regard of his thirſt; becauſe it was obtained with ſo much hazard and difficulty, as appears by the ſubſequent verſe: Be it farre from me, O Lord (ſaith David) that I ſhould do this. Is not this the bloud of the men that went in jeopardie of their lives? Thus if we can hold a reſolution, to put a reſtraint upon our deſires, in thoſe things they ſo eagerly affect; and with all digeſt Anxieties of a lighter ſtamp, andmake them preparatory to heavier afflictions, we ſhall find this courſe very conduceable to our ſatisfaction.\n            \n\n19. PARAGRAPH.\n               NOw I arrive at the approved Antidote, and Soveraign Remedy for all our Evils; and that's devou\n••\n praier. Nothing under Heaven will ſtate us in a peacable quiet condition, if this fail us; without which all our poſſible endeavours and actings for relief, are perfunctory, vai\n••\n and fruitleſſe. It muſt be the fervent and faithful ſupplications of ou\n•\n ſoules, preſented to the Majeſty o\n•\n the Moſt High God, through the precious merits of Jeſus Chriſt, together with the inoperation of that H\n•\n\nly Spirit,\nJa. 1.17.\nfrom whom, every good gift and every perfect giving proceedeth, tha\n•\n can alone both ſettle our inwar\n•\n and outward peace, and free us fro\n•\nthoſe diſturbing perplexities, and diſtractions, wherewith the world is apt to encounter us. Are we environed, with temptations? Praier repels their violent aſſaults. Are we faint and feeble, and compaſſed about with infirmities? TheRo. 8.26\nſpirit of God in prayer, helpes our infirmities, and makes requeſt for us with ſighs, that cannot be expreſſed. It is that ſpirit of Adoption that inſtructs us how to pray. Prayer is like that2 Ki. 2.\nFiery Chariot, wherein Elijah was carryed from earth to heaven: For by it, we poor Mortals, are tranſported to have converſation with God, and to ſpeak with him in a familiar manner; and being in the body, we are carryed out of the body. This praying ſpirit, preſents our ſighs, enflames our affections, and whiſpers words that we are not able to repeat. Whoever ſpeakes againſt us, it becomes our Advocate, and makes requeſt for us, is a meanes to infatuate the Counſels of all our adverſaries, and to remove every prejudice that is caſt upon us. All the imaginablemalice off men and devils, cannot cut off the Intelligence of a Chriſtian with the Lord: though he be ſeparated from all humane ſociety here below, and lock'd up in ſome unacceſſible cave; yet can no man hinder his acceſſe to God, and his addreſſer to Heaven. If his tongue ſhould be cut forth of his head; yet his very ſighs and groanes (which trouble may encreaſe, but cannot deſtroy) will eccho forth his humble requeſts to the Almighty. This is ſingular comfort to the Children of God, that when they are caſt into that extreamity, that neither eye, nor hand, nor tongue, can aſſiſt them in prayer; they may conſider Good King Ezekiah, who was ſo much weak'ned with bodily diſeaſes, and infirmities, that he could not expreſſe his mind, nor pray diſtinctly to his heavenly Father; yet hisIſa. 38.14.\nmourning like a Dove, and chaffering like a Swallow, entred into the Lord's ear, and brought him back a comfortable anſwer. The leaſt word of God, in return of prayer, hath power enough to make theblind ſee, the lame walk, the dumb to ſpeak, the deaf to hear, and ſhe that is ſick of a Feaver to ariſe up and miniſter. We cannot want conſolation if we can get grace to pray. For as our ſupplications aſcend, the multiplyed mercies of God deſcend: light comes to reſolve our doubts, reſolution to expel our fears, comfort to mitigate our troubles, joy to ſeclude our ſorrowes, meanes to ſupply our wants, and ſtrength to ſuſtain our weakneſſe.\n               If we converſe with Scripture, and Eccleſiaſtique ſtory, we ſhall find, what wonderful things have been accompliſhed by this incomparable Engine.Gen. 20.17.18.\nAbraham's praier opened the barren wombs of Abimilech's houſe-hold; andGen. 18. from 22. to 32. cloſed up the hands of the Angels who went with a purpoſe to deſtroy Sodome but could not bring down fire upon it, till righteous Lot was removed thence. The prayer ofEx. 14.22, 23.\nMoſos; parted the Red Sea, and was more forceable to overthrow the Army ofEx. 17.11.\nAmaleck, then all the weapons of Iſrael. The prayer of\nJoſh. 10.12.\nJoſhua made the ſun ſtand ſtill in the Firmament.\n1 Sa. 7.9, 10, 11.\nSamuell's prayer brought loud thunder, and heavy haile-ſtones upon the Philiſtines.\nJa. 5.15, 16, 17.\nEliah's prayer cloſed the heavens for the ſpace of three years and ſix moneths, & opened them again; and this Example St. James applies to every Gooly man; That we ſhould not think they did theſe things, by the priviledge of their perſons, rather then the efficacy of their prayers: he ſhews that Eliah was a man ſubject to the ſame infirmities, whereunto we are ſubject; and that the prayer of any Godly man availes much; yea (if it be fervent) no leſſe then his. And though we work not by prayer ſuch external miracles as he did; yet therby we drawe downe inward grace, bringing light to the blind, life to the dead, and workes an admirable change by repentance. It is ſtoryed of Aurelius Antonius, that in his expedition againſt the Germans, he had in his Army a Legion of Chriſtians, who by their earneſt prayer unto God, obtained rain for the refreſhmentof his Army, when it was like to periſh by thirſt; and likewiſe brought down fearful thunderings upon their enemies: Inſomuch that ever after, he called that Legion, the\n\n〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉\n. Fulminatrix.\nThundering Band.\nThus in all ages prayer hath bin ſo powerful and efficacious, that it hath ſomtimes altered the very courſe of nature without, and at all times wrought a change of corrupt nature within. Nor can it be otherwiſe, if we conſider the moſt effectual interceſſion of our greatHe. 9.11, 12.\nHigh-Prieſt, (Jeſus Chriſt) who preſents our prayers, our praiſes, duties, ſervices and all our ſpiritual performances unto God the Father, and procures acceptance of him. At the very inſtant of our praying, he perfumes the Mercy-Seat (having before ſprinkled it with His bloud) and mingles our duties with His Interceſſions, and together, carries them upon the Golden Cenſer into the Holy of Holieſt, and there preſents them to his heavenly Father; unto whoſe ſacred preſence He takes our perſons (though not perceived by us)as knowing that if they be not accepted, our prayers will not; for though by the Covenant of workes, God did firſt accept the work and then the perſon, yet in the Covenant of Grace, he firſt accepts our perſons(in His Son) and then our performances. And that which is infinite comfort to every Chriſtian, becauſe that in our beſt eſtate, in our moſt refined Condition here below, we are ſubject to many failings and imperfections in our holyeſt duties: Therefore does our Eternal High-Prieſt, diligently obſerve what evils, or infirmities attend our prayers, that may any waies interrupt their acceſſe to heaven, and thoſe he draws out, and takes quite away, before He preſent our petitions to His Father. Here is mercy in ſuch eminent manner, as cannot be ſufficiently expreſſed! And this is clearly held forth by that inEx. 28 & Mal. 3.\nExodus, where the High-Prieſt, after Moſes law (who was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt) took away the iniquities of the Holy things of God's people.\n               To proceed yet further, there isnot any thing that can be expreſſed, that is ſo highly pleaſing to God, as the fervent prayers of his Servants. He delights to have his Holy Name called on, and to be converſed with inan humble ſupplicatory way. We cannot be ſo ready to expreſſe our wants, as God will be to relieve us. If we do in faith and humility, implore the throne of Grace, Almighty God, does moſt certainly, either grant that which we humbly and immediately deſire, or in lieue thereof, ſomething of an higher nature, that may more advantage us, or elſe (that which is a greater mercy then either of the former) he ſanctifyes the want of thoſe things to the ſatisfaction of our ſouls.\n               Seldome or never did any faint under affliction that was attended with a praying ſpirit; It is the moſt powerful help and ſureſt ſupport, that ever Chriſtian was acquainted with. Though all the inveterate perſons in the world were joined in a confederacy to contrive our ruine, and leftno probable waies unaſſayed, \n〈◊〉\n accompliſh and effect that end; ye\n•\n ſuch a regard hath the merciful Majeſty of our God to the prayers o\n•\n his Servants, that they ſhall becom\n•\n a rock to preſerve us, and ſplit ou\n•\n enemies, ſuch a rock, that all the weapons and inſtruments which a\n••\n can imagine, (though put into th\n•\n moſt dexterous hands) ſhall neve\n•\n be able to hawe aſunder. At the voic\n•\n of prayer, the very Gates of heave\n•\n fly open to make way for the aſcenſion of our ſupplications to the mo\n••\n High, at which all the bleſſed Angels in that Celeſtiall Manſion (to ſpeak\n•\n with reverence) even leap for joy. When we are at the greateſt loſſe either in reſpect of our ſpiritual o\n•\n temporal eſtate, prayer comfortably recovers us, renews our acquaintance with God, and ſo enables us to encounter with the greateſt difficulties\n•\n to repel the fiery darts of Satan, and to arme our ſelves againſt the deſtroying influence of his ſubtile inſinuations, whereby he dayly endeavours to deceive us. It is a meanesto fruſtrate the ſinful contrivances of wicked men, and to make diſcovery of their pernitious intendments, and clandeſtine practiſes againſt the righteous, and ſo prevents them. It's a ſpecial remedy againſt the inſurrection of evill \n•\nhoughts, it cruſhes and deſtroies \n•\nhem in embrio, it ſtrikes them with \n•\neath before they can fully recover \n••\nfe; and kills corruptions in the \n••\nud, before they be full blown. And \n〈◊〉\n regard the pureſt gold, may not \n〈◊〉\n altogether free from ſome droſſe, \n〈◊〉\n effectually refines the earthly part \n••\nf a regenerate man, that he may be \n•\nholly fit for his Maſters uſe. Oh! \n•\nhat we could live and die upon this \n•\nbject, in reference to which, time \n•\nould rather faile, then matter to \n•\nſcourſe of. Therefore ſince 'tis \n•\nident, how excellent a meanes \n•\nayer is againſt all our inward and \n••\ntward evils, and what a comfort \n〈◊〉\n all diſtreſſe, let our ſouls and ſpi\n\n•\nes give up themſelves to a conſtant \n•\nnſcientious, practiſe in this ſa\n\n••\ned acceptable duty, that God mayhave the glory, and delight in th\n•\n worke of his own hands, ſo ſhall \n〈◊〉\n be happyed to all eternity.\n            \n\n20. PARAGRAPH.\n               NOW I come to the laſt particular I ſhall inſiſt on, which \n〈◊〉\n this; That we endeavour by all p\n••\n\nſible meanes, and reſolve throu\n••\n Divine aſſiſtance to be truly thank\n••\n to God in each condition, to re\n••\n\npraiſe to His Glorious Name, in w\n••\n ſtate ſoever Providence hath caſt \n〈◊〉\n If there were no other argumen\n••\n the world to engage us to ſuc\n•\n courſe, this alone were ſufficie\n••\n which the Apoſtle Paul aſſerts in \n〈◊〉\n of his Epiſtles, thus:1 The. 5.18.\nIn e\n••\n\nthing give thanks; for it is the will of \n〈◊〉\n in Chriſt Jeſus, concerning you.\n\nWho dares upon reading th\n••\n words, runne into ſuch a conte\n••\n as to violate the Sacred Will of \n〈◊〉\n Moſt High? It rather concernesto give up our lives in an abſolute conformity thereunto.Pſa. 103.1.\nBleſſe the Lord O my ſoul (ſaith David) and all that is within me bleſſe his Holy Name. And in another place,Pſa. 146.2.\nWhile I live will I praiſe the Lord, I will ſing praiſes to my God, while I have a being.\nPſa. 145.2.\nEvery day will I bleſſe thee; And I will praiſe thy Name for ever and ever. He that peruſeth the Pſalmes of this Sacred Pen-man, ſhall almoſt in every page of that book find his earneſt and pathetical exhortations to praiſe God for his Divine love and care, his power and mercy, his Providence, his Word and Ordinances, yea alſo for troubles, afflictions, and every thing. He exhorts allPſa. 148.\nCeleſtiall, Rational, and Terreſtriall creatures to this Duty; and to perform it upon all kinds ofPſa. 150.\nInſtruments. Never was any a greater Scholler in this Schoole, nor a greater Proficient in this work then David, and hath left it as a Rule to all that \n•\nhall ſucceed him. Job was of an excellent temper too, who when he had \n•\noſt his eſtate, loſt his children, and all Relations, that were neer anddear to him, could comfortably ſayJob 1.21.\nThe Lord gives, and the Lord take bleſſed be his name. Though his enemi\n•\n\n encreaſed, and his friends ſtood af\n•••\n off, and he himſelf almoſt given \n〈◊〉\n to the hands of Satan; yet for all th\n••\n he bleſſeth the Lord. If we conſider th\n••\n excellencies of God, we have infin\n••\n cauſe to praiſe him, if we likew\n•••\n look upon the mercies and bene\n•••\n we daily receive, we have as mu\n••\n cauſe to give thankes: There is \n〈◊〉\n condition ſo diſconſolated, but atte\n••\n\ned with ſome good: No darkne\n••\n in that extreamity, but hath \n•\no\n••\n light: No affliction ſo miſerable but is mingled with mercy; therefore we are engaged to be thanke\n•••\n Our Saviour Chriſt could ſay; wh\n••\n he had not where to lay his head,\nMa. 11.25.\nFa\n••\n I thank thee. When he went to his \n〈◊〉\n gony, and ſweat drops of bloud\n•\n There was (ſaies the Text) a Pſa\n••\n\n of praiſe. Who would not be willin\n•\n to follow ſuch a glorious example. There is no affliction that can be\n••\n a Chriſtian (though never ſo ſha\n••\n and grievous) but is uſually atte\n••\n\nedwith this advantage, it gives an opportunity to exerciſe ſuch graces, as patience and the like; which a proſperous eſtate ſeldome or never takes notice of; ſo that if our tribulation ſeem to deprive us of one mercy, it fits us with another; which may juſtly call for our thankfulneſſe. Though the children of Iſrael loſt their Moſes, God gave them a Jo\n•\nhua; Though he took away Ely, he raiſed up Samuel: ſo that this is but mercy exchanged, to the greater benefit of thoſe it reſpects. It is Gods way to examine what ſtock of grace we have, and to make other proviſion for us accordingly. And if he obſerve that our gifts, acquirements, and natural parts ſoar high, and grow ſtrong, and are unwilling to hold proportion with our ſtock of Grace; then doth he mingle our wine with water, and takes us a degree lower; yet nevertheleſſe this loſſe becomes our gain, and this weakneſſe makes us ſtrong: ſo that hence we have abundant cauſe to bleſſe God in this Condition. And though the malice of our enemiespurſue us with terrible perſecutions\n•\n\nPhi. i. 29.\nTo you it is given (ſaith Paul) not \n〈◊〉\n to believe, but to ſuffer; whatſoever \n〈◊〉\n given of God, deſerves our thank\n•••\n It is a great priviledge to be kept pur\n•\n\n and the people of God are never \n\n〈◊〉\n pure then under perſecution. That truth to which we bear teſtimony, an\n•\n for which we ſuffer, encreaſeth an\n•\n ſpreads it ſelf the more through ou\n•\n ſufferings. Therefore let's be adviſed by the Apoſtle Peter,\n1 Pet. 4.16.\nThat if \n〈◊〉\n man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not \n〈◊〉\n aſhamed, but let him glorify God in th\n••\n behalf. And although the ſun-ſhi\n••\n of Gods beautiful aſpect, ſeem ſo eclipſed, that our ſpiritual condition is ove\n•\n clouded, yet it may be day when th\n•\n\nbeames of the Sun do not appear, an\n•\n though it be dark without, there m\n••\n be light within. And this for o\n••\n future comfort is certain, that thoug\n••\n God may for a moment withdra\n•\n His comforting preſence from \n〈◊〉\n children, yet never his ſupporting preſence; They ſtill find that they ha\n••\n that intereſt in him and that depe\n••\n\nance on him, that they would no\n•\nrelinquiſh for all the world; and though they ſeem lowe, even loſt and forſaken, for all this a gracious heart will not renounce the waies of his Saviour; ſo that here's plentiful matter for our praiſe and thankſgiving. And then further, it is an infinite mercy and well worth our thanks, that in all our temptations (though never ſo terrible and impetuous) we have a ſecure refuge to fly to, where we ſhall undoubtedly be relieved;He. 2.18.\nHe was in all things tempted, (ſaith the Author to the Hebrewes) that he might ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.\nJoh 16.33.\nChriſt bids be of comfort, for he hath overcome the world, he hath ſubdued Satan, and bound him up in chains, that he cannot ſtir a foot without permiſſion from above, as is evident by that expreſſion in St. Luke's Goſpel,\nLu. 23.\nSimon, Simon, (ſaith our Saviour) Satan hath deſired thee that he may winnowe thee as wheat, but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not. If he had had power of his own, he would never have asked leave. Jeſus Chriſt praies for us at the very inſtant of our temptation, and is that braſen ſerpent, thatcures us when we are ſtung. And though he ſuffer us ſometimes to be tempted, it is that we may not be2 Co. 12.7.\nexalted above meaſure; to keep us humble, and preſerve us from being ſplit upon ſpiritual Pride, (a rock that would ſoon daſh us in pieces.) Temptation, as one well obſerved, is the ſouls rape, it may offer violence, and deflour our ſouls; but if we do not yield to it, it can never deprive us of our innocency. And how eminent a mercy it is to be kept chaſte unto Chriſt, let every Chriſtian judge. If then there be ſuch juſt cauſe to praiſe God in theſe extremities; Certainly we ſhall meet with much more, in the daily bleſſings and favours that are diſpenſed to us, by the hands of our bountiful Father. But above all that can be thought on, was that eternal mer-of God; in giving his dearly beloved Son, to ſuffer death for our tranſgreſſions, and that in the ſhamefulleſt, and ſevereſt manner that ever ſtory made mention of, for no other end, but that we which were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, might be madealive; that we which were bondſlaves to Satan, might be releaſed from that helliſh thraldome; that we which were vagabonds and aliens, might be made heirs of that incorruptible and Celeſtial inheritance, that never was, nor ever will be capable of diminution or decay. All our daies are too few to ſpend in praiſe for ſuch a glorious endearment as this is; and yet we have many more of a very tranſcendent nature to draw forth our hearts in thankfulneſſe. As that precious Goſpel, and written word of God, that together with the Holy Spirit, conveys the glad tidings of ſalvation to our ſouls; that ſerves as a light to our feet, and a lanthorn to our pathes, that ſearches the dark corners of our hearts, and makes diſcovery of our groſſe corruptions, and ſo ſlaies them; that they may not riſe up in rebellion againſt us, to terrify us at that great and generall day of Judgment; whereto there will be an univerſal Summons, nor any ways be able to contribute to our condemnation. It is likewiſe a great mercy and worth our thanks, that our eyes behold our Teachers, that thedores of Gods Tabernacle are not ſhut \n〈◊〉\n. That we have faithful Paſtors, whole endeavours are daily imployed to gather us into that ſheepfold, wherof Jeſus Chriſt is ſhepherd; and to break that bre\n••\n of life, wrapt up in the word & ordinance\n•\n, and diſpence it to our ſouls, for our ſpiritual nouriſhment, whereby we are further enabled to grow in Grace and holyneſſe from one degree to another, till by that Celeſtial repaſt we attain in an higher improvement and perfection. In may alſo call for our thankful acknowledgements that we are preſerved from peril and bodily danger, to which we are lyable every moment. Should we be dea\n••\n with according to our deſerts, in reſpe\n••\n of our ſins, every morſel we eat might be mixt with poiſon, every ſhower that fall\n•\n from heaven, inſtead of rain, might he ſulphur, and every flaſh of lightning, fire to reduce us to aſhes; The very earth wheron \n〈◊〉\n tread, might open her bowels, and ſwallo\n•\n us quick for our rebellions, as it did\nNumb. 1631.\nCore, Dathan and Abiram. If we caſt our eyes into Holy Writ, and obſerve what fearful judgements God hath inflicted on ſinners, and made them ſudden example\n•\n\nof his juſtice, asGen. 19.26.\nLots wife for her looking back was turned into a pillar of ſalt;\nGen. 19.24.\nSodome for her pride, was deſtroyed with fire and brimstone;\n1 Kings 13.4.\nJeroboam for his burning incenſe, had his hand withered;\n1 Sam. 4.18.\nEly for ſuffering his children to abuſe the Prieſts office, had his neck broke; The\n2 Kin. 2.23, 24.\nchildren for mocking Eliſha, were devoured with bears;\n2 Ki. 9.\nJeſabel for oppreſſing Naboth, was eaten with dogs;\nLev. 10.1, 2.\nNadab, and Abibu, for uſing prophane fire upon the Altar, were conſum'd with fire;\n1 Sam. 15.28.\nSaul for diſobeying Samuel, loſt his Kingdome,\nLu. 1.20.\nZachary for his unbelief, was strucken with dumbneſſe;\nAct. 13.11.\nElymas for hindering the courſe of the Goſpel; with blindneſſe;\n2 Ki. 5.27.\nGehazi, for taking bribes, with leproſy;\nDan. 5.30.\nBalſhazzar, for prophaning the holy veſſels; and\nAct. 5.10.\nAnanias and Saphira, for telling a ly were ſtruk with death; Yea and\nDeu. 32.48, 49, 50, 51.\nMoſes for treſpaſſing at the waters of Meriba, was ſhut out of the Land of Canaan; And that we which are guilty of as great enormities, and yet ſuffered to live free from ſuch puniſhments, is the mirrour of mercy, and that which may juſtly exact praiſeand oblige us to bleſſe God, that he vouchſafes us an opportunity for that purpoſe. Further, that we have liberty, and not only ſo; but invitation and encouragement to pray and make known our wants, and acknowledge our unworthineſſe, and ſolicit at the Throne of Grace for comfort and relief, is all rich matter for our thankfulneſſe. It were an endleſſe task to enumerate the multiplyed occaſions that are daily and hourly offered us, as monitors to this duty. Therefore let's reſolve by the aſſiſtance of the Almighty, to draw forth our hearts and ſouls in all humble thankfulneſſe, in all eſtates, and in all our conditions. Do we pray God in adverſity? It is a meanes, to ſpeak it with due reverence, to engage God to make us proſperous. Do we praiſe him in proſperity? It's a means to continue us in that ſtate. Are we lowe? He will raiſe us, up. Are we deſerted? He will enlarge us and ſhine upon us. He that can bleſſe God, for that his eyes are opened to ſee his ſins; God will open thoſe eyes toſee their Saviour. Do we bleſſe God in affliction? He will make thoſe afflictions bleſſings to us. A Chriſtian that can praiſe and glorify God in adverſity, ſhames Satan and utterly confounds that adverſary: As one very well obſerves, upon this occaſion, and inſtances in that of Job, where the devil ſaies unto God concerning him;\nJob 1.11, 12. & 21.\nDo but touch him and he will curſe thee to thy face: he is in thy hand, ſaith the Lord, only ſave his life; ſo ſatan toucht him. What then? The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away, ſaith Job, bleſſed be his Name. So that we ſee here is bleſſing inſtead of curſing. Job is of another temper then Satan thought him to be of. Thus is it evident how advantageous a thankful heart is upon al al occaſions: and we ſhal more eaſily attain to that temper, if we firſt conſider the intereſt we have in a Saviour, and endeavour to maintain the aſſurance of our union with him; and to perſwade our ſelves that all his diſpenſations proceed from love, and likewiſe that all things work together for our good; which is infalliblytrue in reference to all the Children of God. And laſtly, let's be ſure to maintain the ſenſe of our own unworthyneſſe, both in reſpect of our emptineſſe as creatures, and in reſpect of our ſin as depraved creatures. David was herein a very great Proficient: for there was never any man more thankful then he, as is manifeſt by his whole booke of Pſalmes, as before obſerved, being as it were, compoſed and made up of thankfulneſſe; yet did never any one in the world expreſſe an higher ſenſe of his own unworthyneſſe.\n               Therefore let his eminent example prevaile with us; and engage us to a conſcientious Performance of this and all other Duties, that we have in Command from that inviolable Supreame Authority of Heaven.\nTo cloſe all, That the Dominion of JESUS CHRIST may be Advanced, the Great Name of our GOD Eternally Glorifyed, and that our Immortal Soules maytherein, ever ſee themſelves ſatisfyed and ſaved, is and ever ſhall be the earneſt prayer of\n               \nFrom my Chamber this 7. of Aug. 1650.\n\n\nSIR, Your Devoted and moſt faithfull Servant R.

And Gregory the great, hath an excellent passage wherein he saith, that God doth keepe the soule of a Saints in so even a ballance, counterpoysing vertues with Tentations, (Miro modo agitur, vt nec de virtute, quispiam extolli debeat, nec de tentatione desperet) That hee neede not to be lifted vp with his virtues, nor dispaire for his tentations. Greg. in Iob. lib. 9. cap 5.

They are scourged with the scourges of men,\nHeb. 12. 1 Cor. 11. 32.\nbut the mercy of God is not taken away from them; they are iudged of God, that they may not be condemned with the world.\nBut the same men that are so hard against the Saints, yet they are very kinde to the Reprobates, and they that will not allow a particular grace to giue vnto the Saints a sure salvation, will allow a generall grace to giue vnto all, (Reprobates and all) an vncertaine salvation; Yea, to speake the truth vnder the shew of", "image_url": "A11078/00038.000.001.left.png", "label": "0"}

Origen ſays, that, tho' he had often diſputed with the Jewiſh Rabbins that were of moſt eſteem, he never ſaw any of them approve this Doctrin, that the Word is God, or a God, (in the Platonick or Trinitarian Senſe.)

And then the Meaning being that Chriſtians Sang Hymns to Chriſt AND to God, that is ſo far from implying that they held Chriſt to be God Almighty himſelf, that it ſhews the contrary, Chriſt being there diſtinguiſhed from God. And his being joyned with God, in Hymns Sang to both their Praiſe, argues no more his being God himſelf, than it would argue that Jael is God, becauſe ſhe is bleſſed as well as God in the ſame Pſalm of Praiſe.

Chapter of the Revelations, Men and Angels are repreſented Singing Hymns both to God and Chriſt, ſaying, Bleſſing, Honor, Glory, and Power, be unto Him that ſiteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. Worthy is the Lamb, that was Slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honor and Glory, and Bleſſing.

(ſpiritually accommodated to Chriſt,) beſides that there is no doubt but that the Angels and the Holy Spirits in Heaven may daily preſent Requeſts and Petitions to Chriſt, concerning particular Men and Churches; and when Chriſt is ſeen, he is to be addreſſed unto by Men, as their Saviour, and their Sovereign under God.

And even ſome of theſe Philoſophers, and among them Tertullian particularly, expreſly aſſerted, that mere Creatures, in particular Human Souls, were made out of the Subſtance of God. Howbeit, Platoniſm implying that the Son and the Spirit are above all other Creatures, the Platoniſts generally held that the Son at leaſt or even the Son and the Spirit are moſt peculiarly of the Subſtance of God, were moſt peculiarly in him, and were moſt peculiarly united to him, ſo as that whereever the Son went, and whatever he did, God as it were had always a ſtrict hold of him, and wrought with, in and by him. Nevertheleſs, as was ſaid, they repreſented the Son and Spirit as Diſtinct and Inferior Beings, ſo that they own'd the Father to be properly the Supreme Being, and to be the only Perſon conſequently that is properly God, or a God in the eminent Senſe of the word Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, and, in a word, all the Primitive Doctors that were converted out of Heatheniſm, had been taught Platoniſm; and, when they were become Chriſtians, they openly profeſſed, in all-their Writings, that they were ſtill great admirers of that Philoſophy, and they maintain'd that the Chriſtian Trinity and Plato's Trinity was much the ſame. Thus they introduced Platoniſm in the Chriſtian Syſtem, accommodating the one to the other as near as they could. Juſtin Martyr, it ſeems, particularly began openly to Platonize; and the reſt followed after him. And then they for the moſt part repreſented the Platonick Trinity very like Arianiſm, any of 'em at moſt making it Semi-Arianiſm, & ſo, that the generality of Chriſtians might, it ſeems, miſtake it for Arianiſm, the good Fathers, either purpoſely or otherwiſe, expreſſing themſelves very obſeurely in a moſt Obſcure Matter tho' ſome more Platonically than others.

Century, at the time of the Council of Nice, there were a great many of the moſt Learned Biſhops that were ſtill Semi-Arians, and ſeveral but Arians, moſt credibly according to the Doctrin that anciently was chiefly in vogue, before Semi-Arianiſm was eſtabliſh'd by Juſtin Martyr.\nThe Semi-Arians, or Mildeſt Platonists, like the Arians, defended the Unity of God, by ſaying, that the Father only was the Supreme or Principal God, and that God the Word was not only Leſſer than he, but alſo Subject to him; wherefore they concluded, it might truly be ſaid, that, in Heaven and in the whole World, there is but One Godhead, or but one God, tho' there be God the Father, and God the Son, as in a Houſe where there is a Son Subject to his Father it may be ſaid that there is but one Government, one Maſterſhip or one Maſter, the one not being eſſentially different from the other when both of them perfectly agree.

Man: That tho' as God he knew all things, yet there were ſome Secrets for ſome time concealed from his Human Nature.\n\nWell! Doth the Dr. know of ſome better Solution? No. Is he then very well ſatisfied with this common Anſwer? No. He neither likes this, nor can tell what to ſay more ſatisfactory. Theſe are his words. \"The common Anſwer to this, is, &c. as was ſaid in the foregoing Paragraph: \"And this,\" ſays he, muſt be the true Anſwer, or I know not how we ſhall find a better; and yet it ſeems very hard, that the Son, who is but one Perſon, tho' he have two Natures, ſhould be ſaid not to know that, which he did know, whether he knew it as God, or as Man. This I confeſs is a Difficulty, and always will be ſo, while we know ſo little of this Perſonal Union, that is to ſay, of the Union of the Godhead with the Man Chriſt Jeſus. But then, Dr! if we know ſo little of it, why do you call it a Perſonal Ʋnion, and that of an eternal Son, or an eternal Perſon, with the Spirit of Chriſt? But ſince you are pleas'd to call it ſo, you muſt ſtand to it, and muſt not pretend to evade, by ſaying you know not how far it goes, or what communications the Human Nature of Chriſt receives from its Union with the Godhead. This is not the Point, nor is it at all to the buſineſs in hand, from which you ought by no means to be ſuffered now to flinch away, when it manifeſtly appears to be againſt you and invincibly ſhews the ſolidity of the \nƲnitarian Sentiment. For you have ſaid, and the Trinitarian Syſtem expreſly aſſerts, that the whole Son is but one Perſon, and therefore, tho' you know not exactly how great are the Communications of the ſeveral Parts betwixt themſelves, which conſtitute this one Perſon, yet you muſt own that thoſe Communications muſt needs go ſo far as to make of it but one Perſon. (Even all that paſs for Orthodox, among the Trinitarians, acknowledge, that Chriſt is but one Perſon and but one Son.) Now the buſineſs is to conſider, Whether any thing can be in general terms denied of one Son, or of one Perſon, which yet is true of ſome Part of that Perſon? And the \nƲnitarians maintain, that, upon the conſidering of it, this ought not to be found a mere Difficulty againſt the Trinitarian", "image_url": "A49188/00048.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

(Ibid.)\n\nIn all the Animadverſions againſt Errors by the Apoſtles, no pious Perſon was condemn'd, no Man that did invincibly err, or bona mente; but ſomthing that was amiſs in genere morum, was that which the Apoſtles did redargue. (P. 22.)\nIf a Man mingles not a Vice with his Opinion, tho' he be deceiv'd in his Doctrin, his Error is his Miſery, not his Crime; it makes him an Argument of weakneſs and an object of pity, but not a Perſon ſealed up to ruin and reprobation.

(P. 45.)\nThis Letter was by Socrates called a wonderful Exhortation, full of grace and ſober councels; and ſuch as Hoſius himſelf, who was the Meſſenger, preſſed with all earneſtneſs. (P. 46.)\nThe Apoſtles, who beſt underſtood theſe Myſteries, thought it not fit to uſe any words, in their Creed, but the words of Scripture; to ſhew us, that thoſe Creeds are beſt which keep the very words of Scripture, and that that Faith is beſt which has the greateſt Simplicity. If the Nicene Fathers had done ſo too, poſſibly the Church would never have repented it. (P. 47.)\n", "image_url": "A49188/00060.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

The Deſcription of Ciuita de Vecchia.\n\nCIuita de Vecchia is an ancient Citie of the Popes, lyingDiſtant from England leagues 700. in low ground, a dayes iourney from Rome by land, this City lieth cloſe vpon the Sea, very ſtrongly fortified, and planted with Ordinance, to the Eaſt ſide a ſtrong Caſtle, or Fort: And alſo the like vpon the Weſt ſide, in this place the Popes Gallies lie, and ſhipping. For there is a harbour, and fayre mould for their ſafetie. For the Pope hath no other place for Ships or Gallies but Rome, and there none will come vp but ſmall Barkes, and Boates, and ſuch like, by reaſon of the ſhallowneſſe of the Riuer. In this Ciuita de Vecchia are altogether\n\n\nRomanes, wholly profeſſing the Romiſh Religion, ſaying directly that the Pope is God an earth, and that he can forgiue any ſinne whatſoeuer being committed, which makes the moſt part of them, or all, runne deſperately into moſt deadly ſinnes.\n               For very Murther they hold it no great ſinne, being committed, receiuing of the Popes pardon, or elſe getting into ſome Monaſterie where they may be confeſſed, and abſolued, whereby no Law can take hold of them at their comming forth, being apt and readie within a wéeke, or fortnight after to commit the like Murther, then receiuing the like pardon, or abſolution, as before they had done: and thus many bloodie minded men continue their life-time, for it is an eaſie matter for a man to haue his aduerſarie kild, or poyſoned for money, although his executioner neuer ſée him till ſuch time as he committeth this bloudie déed, being hired by another.\nAlſo in this Countrey their women are very lewde and wicked, for euen in that ancient Citie of Rome, there are many thouſands of lewd liuing women that pay monethly vnto the Pope for the ſinnefull vſe of their wicked bodies: ſome pay ſixe Crownes a moneth, and ſo from ſixe Crownes to one, for they are rated according to their outward ſhew, and for the no\n•\n-payment of this monethly pay, they ſhall haue their goods ſtrained and carried out of their houſes, or chambers, by the Popes officers, and kept from them till ſuch time as ſatiſfaction is made to the Pope. So it is lawfull for any man to vſe any of theſe women as his owne wife, neither ſhall he be moleſted or troubled, or otherwiſe indangered, ſo he eſcape ſecret occaſions of danger, for this woman will be as dutifull vnto him as his ſeruant, alwaies attending his pleaſure for his diet or any thing elſe belonging vnto him: he giuing her content with his purſe; but ſhe not receiuing content may as lawfully arreſt him, and caſt him into priſon till ſuch time as ſhe doth receiue ſatiſfaction, being recouered by Law: for they hold their liuings by the Pope.\nNow as I haue ſpoken of two deadly ſinnes wherein they excéed, ſo will I ſpeake of one thing wherein ſome of them are to be commended, that is this. If there be any Chriſtian, of\n\n\nwhat Nation ſoeuer, poore and in diſtreſſe, making his caſe knowne, and aſking for Chriſts ſake, he ſhall be relieued, with all thoſe neceſſaries whereof he is deſtitute, as apparrell, meat, and drinke, and ſome money, though it be but little: if he be ſicke, then ſhall he be put into an Hoſpitall, where he ſhall be cho\n•\nſely attended vpon, hauing good lodging, dai\n•\ntie diet, and comfortable Phiſicke for the r\n•\nſtoring of his health, whether he be Papiſt or Proteſtant: but if he be a Papiſt, he ſhall be the better vſed, and if he be a Proteſtant they will vſe all meanes they can to conuert him, but force him to nothing at all. In theſe Countries it is dangerous for an Engliſhman being a Proteſtant to ſpeake any thing againſt the Pope, or his Religion, eſpecially vnto another Engliſhman that is a Papiſt, yet this Engliſh Papiſt will ſéeke all the meanes poſſible to intrappe the Proteſtant, and will ſpeake ill words of himſelfe, to draw him to the like, but when he hath made him vtter the ſecrets of his heart, then will he make it knowne, and more then the Proteſtant ſpake, to ſome chiefe man of a Church, by whom he ſhall be forced to alter his Religion, or to be burned, or put in ſome ſecret priſon where he ſhall be ſtarued to death, and this is the manner and faſhion in all Countries of Chriſtendome within the Popes Juriſdiction, not onely of the treacherie of the Engliſh Papiſts, but alſo of the other deadly ſinnes which I touched before, as their murther and adultry: and in like manner of their generall compaſſion, to a diſtreſſed Chriſtian. What I haue héere written, I ſpeake not of heare-ſay, nor by imaignation, but directly haue ſéene, and of mine owne knowledge you may ſpeake it, being too long a time amongſt them, againſt my will.\n            \n\n               II. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Argeir.\n\nARgeir, is a maruellous ſtrong Citie, and gouerned by theDiſtant from England leagues 480. Turk, lying vpon the ſide of an vpright hill, cloſe vpon the Sea, this Citie is very ſtrongly fortified with Caſtels, Forts,\n\n\nand platformes, with great ſtore of Ordinance planted about it, alſo there are many Gallies belonging to this place, which doe much offend the Chriſtians, in taking of their ſhips, Tartanes and Satties, and other ſmall veſſels, making all the Chriſtians that they take ſlaues, & ſelling of them in their markets like horſes: for according to age and ſtrength they are priſed. This Citie is gouerned by a King, being vaſſall to the great Turke. Alſo there are great ſtore of Janizaries in it, to the number of 20. or 30000. at one time: theſe Ianizaries are chiefe Souldiers, and gouerned by a Dane, which is a generall vnder the great Turke. Theſe Turks are goodly people of parſon, and of a very faire complexion, but very villains in minde, for they are altogether Sodomites, and doe all things contrarie to a Chriſtian. For they doe neuer lye in a bed, nor féede vpon a Table; yet their féeding and diet is very plentifull, their bedding and apparrell is very neat and coſtly, the manner of their lodging is thus: There is a very faire table in a roome, about thrée yards in breadth, and as many in length ſtanding in height one yard from the ground, and thereon they vſe to ſpread a double quilt very coſtly with many curious Cuſhions, in ſtead of Pillowes, whereon he lieth downe in his ſhirt, and linnen britches onely, without any other couering, by reaſon of the heat of the countrey. Alſo in the ſame roome he hath another Table laid after the ſame faſhion very richly, whereon his wiues doe lie, but ſhe that likes him beſt, he will take to accompany him for the night. A Turke may haue as many wiues as he pleaſeth, ſo he be able to buy them, and by the number of his wiues, moſt commonly his ſubſtance is knowne, for the richer he is, the more wiues he hath, the poorer the fewer: yet neuer married to none of them, but onely the firſt, but maintaining of them all. It is very dangerous for a Chriſtian to be found in the company of any Turkes woman, for being found together, he ſhall be forced to turne Turke, or elſe be put to death, and the ſaid woman alſo ſhall be put into a ſacke, which being made faſt, ſhe ſhall be flung into the Sea, whether they commit the ſinne or not. Theſe Turkes are very zealous in their religion, acknowledging God; and Mahomet a ſoliciter\n\n\nfor their ſinnes. A Turke will kéepe his word if he ſweares by his head, putting his hand vpon his forehead. In this countrey there is great ſtore of gold and rich Marchants; the manner of their Churches and comming to Prayer is thus. The Church is very faire within, with many hundreds of Lampes burning therein, all matted vnder foote, without any kinde of picture, or ſeats, alſo moſt of them doe pray vpon Beads. In the morning on the top of the Church they hang out a white flag, and in the after noone a blew one for a ſigne of their comming to Church, then goeth eight or tenne of them on the very top of the Church, and crie with a loud voice. Volla, volla hamdrulla and ſhalla, that is to ſay God, God, helpe vs at thy pleaſure, and this is their ordinary warning to come to Church, as we vſe Bels in Chriſtendome, for they abhorre the ringing of Bels, being contrary to their Prophets command.\n               A Turke chooſeth his firſt wife after this maner. He neuer ſéeth his wife till ſhe come to the Church to be maried, for the match is made by their friends, neither is a Turkiſh womans face to be ſéene, becauſe their faces are continually couered going through the ſtréets, both young and old: neither ſhall a manchilde after he is tenne yeeres old euer ſée his mother. A Turke is Circumciſed after this manner. The better Gentleman he is, the longer he ſtayes afore he be Circumciſed, but the time being come, then is he put vpon a very faire white horſe, being very coſtly attired, and before him goeth two, or three hundreth by two and two in purple coates, bearing waxe candles in their hands, and after them followeth a great many playing on diffuſed Inſtruments making of a great noiſe, then followeth a Bull couered with very faire Arras, and his hornes gilded, and next rideth he that ſhall be Circumciſed, with all his friends following, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumciſion, where they cut off the foreſa\n•\nne of his yard, naming of him Morat, Shebane, or Hoſan, or ſome ſuch like name: then will they take the Bull, and turne his head to to the Eaſt-ward, then cut his throat, ſaying, this day wee haue done a good déed, then they cut the Bull in yeeces, and diſtribute it among his friends, and kindred, and ſo they returne\n\n\nhome where they doe feaſt with great ioy.\n               The manner of a Chriſtian turning Turke, is thus. He is put vpon a horſe with his face towards the tayle, and a Bow and an Arrow in his hand, then the picture of Chriſt is carried before him with his feete vpwards, at the which he drawes his Bow with the Arrow therein, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumciſion, curſing his father that begate him, and and his mother that bore him, his Country, and all his kindred: then comming to the place of Circumciſion, he is Circumciſed, receiuing a name, & denying his Chriſtian name, ſo that euer after he is called a Runagado, that is, a Chriſtian denying Chriſt and turned Turke: of which ſort there are more in Turkie and Barbary then of naturall Turkes. The manner of their iudgement for offending of the Law touching death, eyther for theft or murther, is thus: within foure houres after he is taken, he is condemned by certaine chiefe Souldiers, and preſently put to death after this manner, viz. ganſhed, ſ\n•\naked or beat to death. Their ganſhing is after this manner: He ſitteth vpon a wall, being fiue fadomes high, within two fadomes of the top of the wall, right vnder the place where he ſits, is a ſtrong Iron hooke faſtned, being very ſharpe, then is he thruſt off the wall vpon this hooke with ſome part of his bodie, and there he hangeth ſometimes two or thrée daies before he dieth. Staking to death is thus: Around péece of wood thrée yards long, and as big as a mans leg, being ſharpe at one end, is taken and driuen in at the fundament of the offender, and out at his ſhoulder, and ſo they let him lie till he be dead, which ſometimes will not be in a day or two. The manner of beating to death is thus: They take the offender, and lay him down vpon his backe, being naked, and with two double ropes, two ſeuerall men, one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide of him, beate on his belly till he is dead. But theſe deaths are very ſeldome vſed, becauſe they are ſo fearefull to the offenders, yet I haue ſéene them all executed.\n\n\n               III. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Tunys.\n\nTVnys is a great Citie in Barbary, inhabited by Moores,Diſtant from En\n•\nland leagues▪ 600. and ſome Turkes and Jewes. This City is ſpacious, and lieth in low ground, eight miles from the Sea: there belongs to this Citie a verie fayre Caſtle, named the Galletta: This Caſtle is very ſtrong of Ord\n•\nance, and gouerned by Turkes: betwixt the Citie and this Caſtle lyeth the ancient Citie of Carthage, ſunke, by the report of all the Inhabitants thereabouts: but this did I ſée my ſelfe going vp to Tunys in a Boate, the foundation of many houſes for the ſpace of foure or fiue miles, the water being very cleare, and in depth a fadome and a halfe.\nThe Moores of this Countrey are altogether in Religion like to the Turkes, and alſo in habite: they are verie light of foote, and gallant horſemen: they cannot indure Hogs fleſh, nor the drinking of Wine, for they drinke water altogether, except it be ſometimes Aqua-vitae. The manner of their liuing in the Countrey is thus: They will goe fiue or ſixe hundred together, Men, Women, and Children, with their Cammels, Aſſes, and Shéepe, together with all their Poultrie, vnder the ſide of a Mountaine, where euery man pitcheth his Tent, liuing euery man to himſelfe, hauing his Wife and Children about him, with his Seruants and Cattell, thus many Tents are pitched together, to the bigneſſe of a little Towne, continuing there till ſuch time as their Cattell haue eaten vp the graſſe, and then being able to ſtay there no longer, they remooue to another place, where they liue as before they had done: and thus they doe ſpend their liues. By reaſon the Countrey is continually hotte, their féeding is plentifull, but their apparrell poore and bare, neyther haue they any, but what they buy with the increaſe of their Cattell, carrying them often to the Townes, Cities, and Market places néere, where they haue ſale for them. Theſe\n\n\nMoores are very ingenious people, cunning and treacherous.\n               Now leaue we Tunys in the ſame Ship that I came out of England in, named the Francis of Sal\n•\naſh, being bound to Syo within the Arches of Archipelago, and fraighted with Turkiſh goods by Turkes, and ſome Turks aboord with vs, for wée traded as well with the Turke as the Chriſtian: but we had not ſailed aboue foure leagues out of our Port in the night ſeaſon, but that we were moſt fiercely ſet vpon by ſixe of the Duke of Florence his Gallies, (who being in continuall warre with the Turke, tooke vs as a Turkiſh prize) which ſpit fire like diue\n•\ns, to our great diſcomfort, but at length couraging of our ſelues in Gods mercies, we continued fight with them, to the loſſe of many a mans life of each fide, but all in vaine for vs, for they were fortie for one of vs, and our Sip torne downe to the water with their Ordinance, our mayne Maſt, and miſſen Maſt, ſhot by the boord, the \n••\ne end of the Maſt with all the ſayles lying in the Sea, the other end aboord: thus were we taken, and ſtript euery man ſtarke naked, and then were we diſtributed, ſome into one Gallie, and ſome into another▪ where we had as many Irons knocked vpon vs, and more, than then we were able to beare. Our Ship preſently ſent to Ligorne, being mended as well as they could, but we in the Gallies, continued a moneth before we came thither, to the loſſe of many of our liues: but at length comming thither▪ as many of vs as were left aliue were thus intertained. We w\n•\nre all ſhauen both head and beard, and euery man had giuen him a red coate, and a red cap, telling of vs that the Duke had made vs all Slaues, to our great woe and griefe: where I continued eight yéeres and ten moneths in this ſlauerie, as in the next diſcouerie ſhall be truly ſpoken of.\n\n\n               IIII. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Ligorne.\n\nLIgorne is a Citie of the Duke of Florence, and lyeth in lowDiſtant from England leagues 630. ground, hauing many towers without it, ſtanding in the\n\n\nSea, alſo to this Towne doth belong a wilde road, and two very faire moulds for the ſafetie of the Dukes Gallies. In the entrance of theſe moulds is a very ſtrong Caſtle with great ſtore of Ordnance planted: alſo the Towne is very ſtrongly fortified, for it is the chiefe garriſon of the great Dukes, where is continually great ſtore of Souldiers in pay. Which Souldiers are alwaies imployed in his ſhipping or Gallies, wherewith he doth more offend the Turke then all Chriſtendome, for they doe take Gallies and Carmizals and Brigantéens, and Townes of the Turkes and Moores: poſſeſſing of Men, Women, and Children, and ſelling them in Markets, like to Horſes, Cowes, or Shéepe, reſeruing the ſtrongeſt for his owne flauery: In this place I liued eight yéeres, and ten moneths: thrée yéeres of this time I liued in this manner, from Sunne riſing to Sunne ſet, chained in a Cart like a horſe, receiuing more blowes then any Cart-horſe in England, our diet being Bread and Water, and not ſo much Bread in thrée daies as we might haue eaten at once, thus we were vſed to goe fortie or fiftie Carts together, being all ſlaues: our lading would be Sand, or Lyme, or Bricke, or ſome ſuch like, and to draw it whither the Officers appointed vs, for their buildings. Theſe Italians are very deceitfull people, for when they laugh in a mans face, they will ſéeke to kill him, yet they are very cowards being naturall Italians: their women are altogether wicked and lewde. Thrée yéeres being ſpent in this manner: all we Engliſh▪men were called as many as were left aliue, making choiſe of the ableſt of vs to goe into the Gallies, of which I was one choſen, then did my miſerie increaſe many-fold, for then I was made a Gally▪ſlaue to row at an Oare, where our former diet leſſened▪ but blowes increaſed, to the loſſe of many of our liues. We were ſhauen Head and Beard euery eight or tenth day, being alwaies naked, but onely a payre of linnen bréeches and chaines continually. In this time I was at the taking of many a Towne and Gally of the Turkes, though ſore againſt my will, ſéeing of many Cities, Ilands, and mayne Lands in the time of my ſlauerie, where I continued ſixe yéeres a Gally-ſlaue,\n\n\nfinding in all this time much comfort and reliefe from Engliſh Marchants that were Proteſtants, and alſo from many Engliſh Maſters and owners of Ships. But from Engliſh men being Papiſts none at all. The miſerie of the Gallies doth ſurpaſſe any mans iudgement or imagination, neyther would any man thinke that ſuch torture, or torment were vſed in the world, but onely they that féele it, the extreamitie of miſerie cauſeth many a ſlaue to kill themſelues, or elſe ſéeke to kill their Officers; but we were not ſuffered to haue ſo much as a knife about vs, yea if we had gotten one by any extraordinarie meanes, and offered any violence to any Officer, we ſhould preſently haue loſt our noſe and eares, and receiued a hundred blowes en our bare backe, and a hundred on our belly with a double rope, or a Buls piſ\n•\ne, continuing a ſlaue ſtill: But I intreated the Almightie God to grant me grace that I might indure it patiently, that féeling that extreamitie in bodie in this world, how farre would the torments of hell haue ſurpaſſed and excéeded it, if I had in this my earthly torture béene acceſſary to mine owne death, as many were. But at length God of his great goodneſſe and mercy, deliuered me (according to my hope) in this manner. The great Duke fitted a ſhip▪ a Tartane and a Frigot, being very well appointed and victualled, diſpeſing of them into the Weſt Indies, and chiefely for the Kiuer of the Amazons, appointing Captaine Robert Thornton, an Engliſhman to be chiefe Commaunder of the Ship, the Tartane and the Frigot: ſo likewiſe was euery other Officer appointed by the Duke himſelfe; inſomuch as ſpeaking of the placing of a Phiſition, a Surgion, and a Surgions mate, Captaine Thornton ſtanding by, ſaid, your Highneſſe may doe well to deliuer a poore Engliſhman that hath continued a great while in your Gallies: hée is well experimanted in P\n••\nſicka, and Surgery, by reaſon of his long practiſe both by Sea an Land: he is hardned to the Sea, and able to diſcharge the place better then the thrée before mentioned: for in the Gallies he doth your Highnes but the labour of one ſlaue: whereupon the Duke demaunded my name. Captaine Thornton anſwered, and ſaid, William Dauies: whereto the Duke\n\n\nreplied, I haue often béene ſpoken to for that fellow, whoſe liberty now I giue vpon thy good report, Thornton, but yet I doubt his vſage hath béene ſo hard in my Countrey, that as ſoone as hée is out of chaynes, he will giue me the ſlip and not goe the voyage into the In\n•\nies with thée. But if he can giue fiue hundred Crownes ſecuritie to goe the voyage, hée ſhall be releaſed preſently out of chaynes: neyther ſhall hée want any thing that is needfull for the voyage, \n•\nor the good of all the Company, or for his owne bodie, and this let him vnderſtand as ſoone as may be: which newes came within two dayes vnto me, to my great reioycing & comfort, but as ſoone as I heard it, I ſodainly ſate down, being at my ol\n•\n profeſſion, carrying of durt, and ſtone, and ſuch like in a baſket, and would worke no longer, neyther ſuffer the ſlaue to worke that was chayned vnto mée, but as ſoone as I was eſpied, one of the Maſters of the worke came to mée, and ſaid thou Lutheran Dogge: Why workeſt thou not? and with that ſtrake me with a Cudgell, whereto the ſlaue that was chayned with me, replied. The Duke hath giuen him his libertie: then ſaid hée that had ſtroken mée, Maſter, I beſeech you forgiue mée, and excuſe my raſhneſſe, doubting that I ſhould haue remembred his former courteſies being at libertie. And within a ſhort time after Captaine Thorneton came from Florence to Ligorne, where I was, who then tolde mee the Dukes diſpoſition to the full, and vpon what ſecuritie I ſhould be deliuered: which ſecuritie I did ſodainely procure by an Engliſh Marchant, whoſe name was Maiſter William Mellyn, of Briſtow, who paſſed his Band for fiue hundred Crownes to the Duke, for the performance of the voyage by mée: Whereupon I was ſodainely releaſed out of chaynes, to my great reioycing, giuing God thankes for his bleſſings. Then was I preſently well apparrelled by Captaine Thorneton, and this Marchant, wanting nothing whereof I was deſtitute: But within two or three dayes after I was ſent for, by the great Duke, to come vnto him to Archemeyne, where then hée continued, whither ſodaynely I repayred, and comming to the Dukes preſence,\n\n\ndoing my dutie, he ſaid vnto me, be of good comfort I haue giuen thée grace, with thy liberty, neyther ſhalt thou want any thing for the fitting of thy voyage, or néedful for thy owne bodie, therefore ſpeake boldly, and demaund any thing that ſhall be neceſſary, and I will haue thée well fitted: for the great Duke of Florence wants no money. Then he demaunded of me further what I was in mine owne Countrey, whither I was a Gentleman or no. I anſwered his highneſſe I was: then he aſked me how? I told him my father was a Gentleman, and for my part I had ſerued my Quéene by Lano and by Sea, againſt the aduerſaries of my Quéene and Countrey, and had loſt mine owne bloud, and ſpilt my enemies bloud: and next that I was a Gentleman by Art. Then the Duke anſwered and ſaid: Thou art a worthy fellow, for thou haſt indured much miſerie in this world. But tell me, quoth hée, with what ſubſtance of wealth cameſt thou out of thy Countrey: I anſwered with two purſes full: Full ſaid hée, of what? I ſaid of Siluer and Gold, which I loſt when I was taken by his Highnes Gallies, and the other full of Patience, which doth continue full ſtill: Then ſaid the Duke to one that ſtoode by, giue him a hundred Crownes to ſpend to ſtrengthen himſelfe, and bring himſelfe to courage; thus did the Duke take delight in diſcourſing with me, in reſpect I ſpake the Italian tongue very perfectly, for I bought it déere, with many a droppe of my bloud, in the time of my ſlauerie. Then receiuing this hundred Crownes, which the Duke had giuen me, I left his Court, comming preſently to Ligorne, where the Ship lay, indeauoring of my ſelfe, by my labour, and induſtrie, for the fitting of all things neceſſary for the good of the Uoyage, vpon the Dukes charge, beſides this hundred Crownes: for they were giuen mée to ſpend at my owne pleaſure, which I did, to the comfort of many Engliſh-men that lay in chaines, that were taken with mée: they wanted neyther meate nor drinke as long as my money laſted, as many of them as were left aliue, for of ſeuen and thirtie of vs that were taken at the firſt, there remayned then but thirtéene, whereof tenne continued in chaines, and two were deliuered with me. By this time\n\n\nall things were prepared and made readie for the performance of our pretended Uoyage, now being bound to ſerue in the good Ship called the Santa Lucia, with a Frigot, and a Tartane, well victualled, and well manned, and chiefely bound to the Riuer of Amazones, with other ſeuerall Riuers, the which the Duke would haue inhabited, hoping for great ſtore of gaine of Gold, but the Countries did affoord no ſuch thing, as hereafter ſhall be ſpoken of. Upon this Uoyage we were fouretéene moneths, making little gaine, or benefit for the Duke, for there was nothing to be gained. Now are we homewards bound, and recouering the ſtraits againe, & being within three or foure dayes ſayle of our owne Port, Ligorne: in the night ſeaſon we met with an Engliſh Pirate, who would haue taken vs, but was not able, yet held vs fight all the whole night, and kild vs a man, and hurt other two: whereof one was an Engliſhman, who died within two dayes after we recouered Ligorne, and being dead I went to the Captaine and demaunded of him where he ſhould be buried, but he \n•\nad him goe aſke of one father Sherwood an Engliſhman, ſo he told mée that if he were a Romane Catholike they would burie him in the Church, but if he were not, I ſhould bury him out in the fields: But yet for my better aſſurance I went and aſked of the Friers of the Miſericordia, who alſo gaue their aduiſe, and counſell that he ſhould be buried in the fields, becauſe he was no Romane Catholike, whereupon I buried him in this manner.\n               I intreated the company of many Engliſhmen that were Proteſtants to helpe me to ſhroud him, and alſo to accompany me to the burying of him, which they did in this manner. We put him vpon a Beare, being ſhrowded with a couering ouer him, and carried by foure men, many Engliſhmen that were Proteſtants followed him, bearing euery man a branch of Roſemary in his hand to the place where we buried him, reading Prayers ouer him after the Engliſh manner. His name that was buried was Eraſmus Lucas, and borne in Southwarke néere vnto London. Two daies being ſpent after his buriall, & was ſought for by an Italian Fryer, who finding of me, demaunded\n\n\nof me my name, which preſently I told him, then he replied, thou art he that I looke for, for thou haſt buried a good Chriſtian, and a Romane Catholike out in the fields, like to a Dog and a Lutheran as thou art thy ſelfe: therefore I charge thée in the Dukes name to goe along with mée, which command I durſt not denie, but went with him, where he brought me before thrée or foure aged Friers of the Inquiſition, & they aſked of me whether I were that Lutheran that buried a good Chriſtian in the fields, for he was a Romane Catholike, and confeſt, and receiued the Sacrament like to a good Chriſtian, and therefore thou ſhalt be burned, for thou haſt done contrary to the Law of Rome. I anſwered that I had buried a good Chriſtian, but not a Romane Catholike, neither was he confeſt, nor receiued the Sacrament: they replied, if this be not true which thou haſt ſaid thou ſhalt ſurely die for it. Therefore take him, and put him into the ſecret, whither vnto I was brought, which is a priſon in this manner: Many double doores being opened, I paſſed through two or thrée outward priſons then comming to the doore of the ſecret, whereinto I was thruſt, it was ſo darke that I could ſée no part of my body, then féeling round about me with my hands, I found it to be very ſhort in length, & leſſe in breadth, but of height I know not how high, becauſe I could neither ſée nor féele the top. In this place I was almoſt ouer ſhoes in the filth of other men that had died there before, who neuer liued aboue eight or ten daies there at the moſt: Then wrapping one arme within another, and leaning againſt the wall, calling to minde Iobs miſeries and Daniels afflictions amidſt the Lions, and incouraging my ſelfe in Gods mercy, ſung a Pſalme very chéerefully to the praiſe and glory of God, wherein I was greatly comforted. Then did I draw off my ſhoes and ſtockings, & with my bare féete ſwept all the traſh and filth into one corner. In this manner I liued fortie houres before any ſléepe poſſeſt me, and then being deſirous of ſléepe, I ſate downe and leaned my head againſt the wall, and ſlept very ſoundly, being altogether comforted with a liuely hope in the Almighty God, that he would deliuer me (according to my truſt) as he had done before. And when moſt extreames\n\n\nwould oppreſſe me, then would I be moſt ioyfull, finding alwaies an inward motion, ſaying, be of good comfort, the Lord will deliuer thée: In this manner I liued ſixtéene daies, my food being bread & water, and my lodging vpon the cold ſtones, and being yet aliue, they held it a miracle that I ſhould liue there ſo long, ſaying, this Lutherane hath a Lions heart, for we neuer knew any to liue aboue ten daies, wherfore let vs haue him forth to be examined. Then was I brought before the high Inquiſitioner, who demanded of me, whether he that I buried had receiued the Sacrament & confeſt, according to the Romane order or no, I anſwered no; he was a good Chriſtian, but receiued not the Sacrament, nor was not confeſt, after the order of Rome: then he ſaid that he was, by a Frier of the Meſericordia, & therefore thou ſhalt be burned. Then I intreated that I might but ſpeake, and he ſaid ſpeake on: then I aſked them this, whether the Frier that confeſt him could ſpeak any Engliſh or no, he anſwered that he could ſpeake none: then tell me quoth I, how an Italian Frier (can confeſſe an Engliſhman ſpeaking no Engliſh, nor the Engliſhman ſpeaking no Italian, nor other language but his mother tongue? for you know wel there muſt be no interpreter in confeſſion, & if the Sacrament were miniſtred vnto him, the houſe where he died can iuſtifie it. Then the Inquiſitioner hearing this, ſcratched his head, ſaying, this fellow hath ſpoken the truth, wherfore take him and put him out into a large priſon, whether I was brought, where I liued ten wéeks being well, and often relieued by Engliſh Proteſtants, who reioyced much to ſee me aliue. Theſe malicious Friers, there reaſon wherefore they ſought my life was, becauſe they would haue the dead mans pay to themſel\n•\nes, which if he had béene a Roman Catholik had bin their due, & in reſpect he was not, they miſt of the pay, & of their wicked pretence againſt me, (God I giue him thanks) by reaſon I could ſpeak the Italian tongue, for if I had had an interpreter in this, though my cauſe was iuſt, yet I had ſurely died. Ten wéeks being ſpent in this priſon, it was the fortune of one M. Richard Row of Milbrooke, in the countie of Cornwel, to ariue at Ligorne, in the good ſhip called the Portion he being owner & Marchant of the ſaid ſhip, & one day comming\n\n\nto the Priſon grate demaunded of me what Countrey-man I was, I told him I was borne in the Citie of Hereford. He aſked my name: I anſwered William Dauies. Said he, know you one Maſter Dauies in Plymmouth. I ſaid I was an vnfortunate brother of his. With that he was very ſorely grieued, in reſpect he knew my brother very well, and loued him directly, and told me if all the meanes that he could vſe could deliuer me, he would: therefore ſaid hée, thinke with your ſelfe, how I may deliuer you, and I will be backe againe with you within theſe two or thrée houres: whereupon he deliuered me ſixe Crownes, and bid me ſpare for no money, for he knew my brother would repay it againe: then leauing me, I ſate downe and leaned my head vpon my hand, ſetting my elbow vpon my knée, intreating my Almightie God, to ſhew me ſome direct courſe whereby I ſhould be deliuered. Then preſently came into my head, to ſend for a Frenchman, in whoſe houſe I had alwaies layne before, who preſently came vnto me, vnto whom I imparted my minde, telling of him that if he would faine a matter of debt againſt me, I would giue him ten Crownes for his labour, though I ought him nothing: but he anſwered and ſaid it was dangerous, for it was a Gally-matter, but I vewed it ſhould neuer be made knowne by me: Whereupon he gaue conſent, and went to the Gouernour and told him, that in the Priſon where debters are, there is an Engliſhman who oweth me money, and we were agréed, then ſaid the Commiſſarie if thou art content, let him pay the charge of the houſe, and be gone: which charge I paid preſently, and was fréed, departing away with the Frenchman, and brought him to Maſter Hunts houſe, the Engliſh Counſell, where I gaue him his tenne Crownes. So leauing one another, I went preſently aboord of Maſter Rowes Ship, being then bound for Naples, vnto which place wée came, whoſe deſcription followeth.\n            \n\n               V. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Naples.\n\nNAples is a famous and moſt worthy Citie very ſpatious,Diſtant from England 700. leagues. ſtanding cloſe vpon the Sea, meruailous ſtrongly fortified and planted with Ordnance, in many ſeuerall Caſtles, Bulwarks, Forts, and ſuch like: Alſo to this Citie doth belong many Gallies, and very good ſhipping, and continually great ſtore of ſhipping rides before it, this Citie lies in the Land of Calabria, and is gouerned by a Vice-Roy, vnder the King of Spayne: alſo there are many Souldiers in Garriſon, being all Spaniards. The King of Spayne maintaynes many P\n•\nnti\n•\n\nners there. In this Citie they ſpeake ſeuerall Chriſtian languages, becauſe there are of all Nations in Chriſtendome but principally Italians, and Spanyards. The Neopolitans are very proud, and of a leftie ſpirit, being for the moſt part very rich, and coſtly attired, and moſt commonly well furniſhed inwardly with their Countrey diſeaſe. They are altogether Papiſts, and their women very audacious, eſpecially in the ſinfull vſe of their bodies, by reaſon they haue as well their pardon as priuiledge from Rome. In this Citie it is verie dangerous to walke by night, for a man may ſodainly be kild for the cloathes on his backe, whither hée be poore or rich. In this place are alwaies great ſtore of Marchants and Lidgers of ſeuerall Countries, as ſpecially Engliſh, Dutch, Greekes, Italians, Uenetians, French, Spaniard, Jew, with many other Chriſtian Nations. The chiefe commoditie that theſe Merchants deale in, is \n•\naw▪ Silke, or Silke wrought, eyther into Sattens, Taffities, Grograms, and diuers other ſilke ſtuffes, Silke ſtockings, Laces of all ſorts, & Garters of ſeuerall ſorts. In this place I haue béene diuers times, and neuer found any thing note-worthy, but onely one, which was this. A mine vnderneath a great Mountaine about a mile or thereabouts in length. This vault was digged by the induſtrie of men for a paſſage from the Citie to an Iland called N\n•••\nta, where all\n\n\nſhipping doth ſtop before they come to the Citie; The reaſon wherefore this paſſage was inuented, is becauſe the mountaine ouer it is ſo ſléepe that there was no paſſage ouer it, except they would goe twentie miles about, but now Coaches, Wagons Carts, horſe or foote may paſſe as ſmoothly through as in a plaine way, continually hanging within it great ſtore of Lampes: this vault is in height about fiue fadame, and foure in breadth, it is named the Grout, & by common report one Virgil a learned man was the Author of it, whoſe Tombe is aloft in each end of it, hauing a Lampe hanging continually before it: Through this place I haue oft and many times paſſed: and therefore vpon my owne knowledge I can aſſure what I haue written.\n            \n\n               V. The Deſcription and diſcouery of the Riuer of Amazons.\nTHe Riuer of the Amazons lieth in the higheſt part of theDiſtant from England 1600 \n〈…〉\n\n West Indies, beyond the Equinoctiall line; to fall with this Riuer fortie leagues from Land you ſhall haue eight, ſixe, and ſeauen fadome water, and you ſhall ſée the Sea change to a ruddie colour, the water ſhall grow freſh, by theſe ſignes you may run in boldly your courſe, and comming néere the Riuers mouth, the depth of your water ſhall increaſe, then you ſhall make diſcouery of the trées before the land, by reaſon the land is very low, and not higher in one place then another thrée \n•\noote, being at a ſpring tide almoſt all ouer flowne, God knowes how many hundred leagues. It flowes much water there with a very forcible tide. In this Riuer I continued ten wéekes, ſeeing the faſhion of the people and countrey there: This Countrey is a together full of woods, with all ſorts of wilde beaſts, as Lions, Beares, Wolues, Leopards, Baboones, \n•\nrange Bores, Apes, Monkies, Martyns, Sanguins, Marmoſets with diuers other ſtrange beaſts: alſo theſe woods are \n•\null of wilde-fowle of all ſorts, and Parats more plentifull then Pigeons in England, and as good meat, for I haue often\n\n\neaten of them. Alſo this Countrey is very full of Riuers, hauing a King ouer euery Riuer. In this place is continuall tempeſts as lightning, thunder, and rayne, and ſo extreame, that it continues moſt commonly ſixtéene or eightéene houres i\n•\n foure and twentie. There are many ſtanding \n••\nters in this Countrey, which be full of Aligators, G\n•••\nes, with many other ſeuerall water Serpents, and great ſtore of freſh fiſh, of ſtrange faſhions. This Countrey is full of Muskitas, which is a ſmall Fl\n•\ne, which much offends a ſtranger comming newly into the Countrey. The manner, faſhion, and nature of the people is this: They are altogether naked, both men and women, hauing not ſo much as one three\n•\n about them to couer any part of their nakedneſſe, the man taketh a round Cane as big as a penny candle, and two inches in length, through the which he puls the fore-ſkin of his yard, tying the ſkin with a péece of the rinde of a tree about the bigneſſe of a ſmall packethréed, then making of it faſt about his middle, he continueth thus till he haue occaſion to vſe him. In each eare he weareth a Réed or Cane, which he bores through it, about the bigneſſe of a Swans quill, and in length halfe an inch, and the like through the midſt of the lower lip: alſo at the bridge of the noſe he hangs in a Reed a ſmall glaſſe Bead or Button, which hanging directly afore his mouth, flies too and fro ſtill as he ſpeaks, wherein he takes great pride and pleaſure. He weares his hayre long, being rounded below to the nether part of his eare, and cut ſhort, or rather as I iudged pluckt bald on the crowne like a Frier. But their women vſe no faſhion at all to ſet forth themſelues, but ſtarke naked as they were borne, with haire long of their heads, alſo their breaſts hang very low, by reaſon they are neuer laced or braced vy: they do vſe to annoynt their bodies, both men and women, with a kinde of red earth, becauſe the Muskitas or Flies ſhal not offend them. Theſe people are very ingenious, craftie▪ and treacherous, very light of foote, and good Bowemen, whoſe like I haue neuer ſeene, for they doe ordinarily kill their owne foode, as Beaſts, Fowle, and Fiſh, the manner of their Bow and Arrowes is this. The Bow is about two yards in length, the Arrow ſeauen foot. His\n\n\nBowe is made of Brazill wood very curious, his ſtring of the rinde of a Trée, lying cloſe to the Bow, without any bent, his Arrow made of a Réed, and the head of it is a fiſh bone, hée kils a beaſt in this manner: ſtanding behinde a Trée, hée takes his marke at the beaſt, and wounding him, he followes him like a Bloud-hound till he fall, oftentimes ſeconding his ſhoote: then for any fowle be he neuer ſo little, he neuer miſſes him: as for the firſt, he walkes by the water ſide, and when he hath ſpied a fiſh in the water, he preſently ſtrikes him with his Arrow, and ſodainly throwing downe his Bow, he leaps into the water, ſwimming to his Arrow which he drawes a-land with the fiſh faſtned to it, then hauing each kild his owne ſood, as well fleſh, and fowle, as fiſh, they méet together, to the number of fiftie or ſi\n•\ntie in a company, then make a fire after this faſhion: They take two ſtickes of wood, rubbing one hard againſt another, till ſuch time as they be fired, then making of a great fire euery man is his owne Cooke to broyle that which he hath gotten, and thus they féede without Bread or Salt, or any kinde of drinke but Water and Tobacco, neither doe they know what it meanes: In theſe Countries we could finde neither Gold nor Siluer Dare, but great ſtore of Hennes. For I haue bought a couple for a Jewes Harpe, when they would refuſe ten ſhillings in mo\n•\ney. This Countrey is full of delicious fruit, as \n•\nynes, Plantins, Euaues, and Potato rootes, of which fruits and rootes I would haue bought a mans burthen for a glaſſe Button or Bead. The manner of their lodging is this: they haue a kinde of net made of the rinde of a Tree which they \n••\nll Haem\n•\nc, being thrée fadome in length, and two in breadth▪ and gathered at both ends at length, then faſtning eyther end to a Trée, to the full length about a yard and halfe from the ground, when he hath deſire to ſléepe, hée créepes vnto it The King of euery Riuer is knowne by this manner. He wear\n•\ns vpon his head a Crowne of Parats feathers, of ſeue\n•\nal\n•\n\n\n••\no\n••\ns, hauing eyther about his middle, or about his necke \n•\n chaine of Lyons teeth or clawes, or of ſome other ſtrange \n••\na\n••\n, hauing a woo\n••\nen ſword in his hand, and hereby is he knowne to be the King: Oftentimes one King\n\n\nwarres againſt another in their Canowes, which are Boats cut out of a whole Trée, and ſometimes taking one another the Conquerers eates the Captines. By this time ten wéeks were ſpent, and being homewards bound, but not the ſame way that we came, for we ſayled vnto the Riuer before the winde, becauſe it blowes there continually one way, which forces all ſhips that come thither to returns by a contrary way.\n            \n\n               VII. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Malta.\n\nMAlta is a ſmall Iland, very famous, hauing two CitiesDiſtant from England \n•••\n\n\n•\neagu\n••\n. vpon it called Terra-noua, and Terra-vecha being ſ\n•\nituate very néere one another. This Iland is gouerned by a great Maſter, who acknowledgeth no Superiour vpon earth, but the Pope to be Supreame head of the Church. The great Maſter liues in Terra-noua, which is a great Citie, lying cloſe vpon the Sea, marueilous ſtrongly fortified and planted with Ordnance the like is not in Chriſtendom, for the Turke hath oftentimes ſought to take it, with two or thrée hundred ſayle of Gallies at a time, but yet was neuer able to take any part of it. To this Iland doth there belong Gallies, though they be but few, to the number of ſixe or eight ſayle, and alſo ſhipping, wherewith they doe much offend the Turke, taking of them very often, and making them ſlaues: In this Iland they hold the Romiſh Religion, both men and women, their women are altogether laſciuious and lewdly giuen, but there men are valiant, Gentlemen, and worthy men at armes: they are of all Nations of Chriſtendome, ſpeaking generally all languages, alſo they haue an ancient order of Knighthood, ſworne by the Croſſe of Saint Iohn, which is a forked white Croſſe which they weare vpon their breaſts to be knowne to be C\n•\nu\n•\nliers and Knights of Malta. The manner of their▪ Oath of Knighthood is this: that they ſhall neuer marry, by reaſon they ſhall neuer haue Children legitimate: for there are many Lords\n\n\nand Noble men ſent thither by their Uncles to be Knighted, becauſe they ſhall neuer marry, whereby after his death his lands ſhall come to his Uncles iſſue, yet they are ſuffered to haue as many whores as they will. Another part of their oath is this. A Knight of Malta is ſworne not to ſtand in place where two, thrée, or foure are vpon one in fight, but to take the weaker part, & to fight to the laſt. They are all of bold courage, being to the number of fiue thouſand or there abouts, in Malta and other Chriſtian places: another part of their oaths is this, by Land or Sea, whether it be in ſhip or Gally, they are ſworne to incounter their aduerſaries, though they be thrée to one, and neuer to yéeld or ſlip away, for they are ſworne to fight it to the laſt mans death: The which oath they performe very couragiouſly, for they are Gentlemen of very great reſpect, neyther will they euer fall out amongſt themſelues, being forbidden by another part of their oath. As for their maintenance, the poorer ſort haue a pention from the great maſter, which maintains him very gallant, and the richer ſort liue vpon their owne charge. One thing there is ſtrange in that Iland, thoſe that are borne without the cities ſpeak altogether the Moriſco tongue, being altogether like Moores. This Iland is very plentifull and fruitful of all things, eſpecially, Wine, Corne, Fiſh, Fleſh, and Fruits. Theſe Knights are very mercifull, hauing their aduerſaries proſtrate, greatly regarding their Oath.\n            \n\n               VIII. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Cyprus.\n\nCYprus is a famous Iland of the Turks, hauing two CitiesDiſtant from England 1000. leagues. and many Townes vpon it; The chiefeſt Citie vpon it is Famagoſta: this Citie lies cloſe vpon the Sea, in low ground, being very ſtrongly fortified & walled about, and gouerned by Turkes, holding their owne Religion, belieuing and confeſſing God the Father, and their Prophet Mahomet, doing all things contrary to a Chriſtian, yet though they doe not acknowledge Chriſt to be the Son of God, and a God, yet they ſay he is the\n\n\nbreath of God, and by the Jewes put to death, but they doe not beléeue that he is riſen again. They hate a Jew aboue any nation euen as they do the diuel, neither do they care to kill him, no more then they doe a dog, oftentimes killing them in the very ſtréets vpon the leaſt occaſion, if it be but for touching his garment as he paſſeth by him: yet their liues many Jewes in all parts of the Turkes dominions, but in this manner. They will ſuffer neither man, woman, nor childe to plucke vp their ſhoes on their héele, if they be Jewes, but goe alwaies ſlipſh\n•\nd and barelegd, wearing a blacke cap vpon his head, and carrying of a buckram ſack vpon his ſhoulders empty, to ſhew that he is a Jew, & a ſlaue to the world. In this Iland of Cyprus, without the Cities and Towns, the Countrey is inhabited by Greeks, liuing vaſſals to the Turks, paying to the Turke the tenth of all that they poſſeſſe, euen to the tenth of their children, if they amount to that number, and that tenth childe is Circumciled and made a Turke, receiuing an Oſper a day from the great Turke for the firſt yéers, and for the ſecond two, and for the third thrée, per diem, and ſo his pay increaſeth an Oſper yéerely as he groweth in yéeres, for he is choſen from his infancy to be a Souldier of the great Turkes, and ſo ſhall all his male children receiue the like pay, and be Souldiers to the Turke: their garments being welt\n•\nd about the necke with a welt of purple ſilk, wherby they are known from others. This Oſper is the eleueuth of a ſhilling Engliſh. So that at twentie yéeres of age he ſerues in the field, his pay being worth ninteen pence a day, and ſo increaſing with his yeeres. This Iland of Cyprus is very fruitfull, hauing great ſtore of ſilke wo\n•\nmes, which yéeldeth them abundance of Silke. Alſo this Iland yéelds great ſtore of fruits of all ſorts, and ſtore of Cattell of all ſorts: Thrée ſorts of Beaſts this Iland yeeldes, which differ farre from ours in England, that is to ſay, a Bu\n•\n\nfella differs from an Ore, their Cammels from our Horſes, and their Sheepe from ours. The Bu\n•\nfella is a Beaſt after the manner of an Ore, but that hée is bigger, and not ſo high, nor ſo long as the talleſt of our Oxen, yet one of them is as ſtrong as thrée of our Oxen, for two\n\n\nof them doe the labour of ſixe Oxen: their hornes are flat, and at mid-day when they vſe to reſt them, they take them, and turne them into a water, where they will ſtand for the ſpace of two houres couered quite ouer the backes in water, then will they yoke them and worke them as freſh till night, as they did in the Morning, without any bayting at all. Their Cammels is a meruailous tall beaſt, hauing a necke twiſe as long as a Horſe, and a great bunch growing about the middle of his backe, as bigge as a pecke, hée is clouen footed, and his tayle little, and for his ſtrength he will carry as much on his backe as foure horſes, and continue with his carriage on his backe thréeſcore houres without meat or reſt. I haue ſéene foure thouſand of them laden at one time with Merchandiſe going a very ſlow pace, and nothing ſo faſt as a Carriers horſe, yet will they continue that pace two dayes and two nights together, without any eating or drinking: and when they doe reſt and féede, it is but ſlender and verie little, in this manner: when they come to their reſting place they lye downe with their lading vpon their backes. Then the Moores or Turkes, put a Ball made of Date ſtones beaten, into euery one of their mouthes, the pouder of the ſtones being compounded with Linſéede Oyle, and the white of Egges, which makes the Balls as hard as Stones, and thus they will liue and continue their trauaile ſixtéene dayes and nights together, receiuing the ſaid reſt and reliefe at euery two dayes end. Their Shéepe are twiſe as bigge as ours in England, but in all faſhions like our Shéepe, except the tayle, for their tayles are meruailous great, broad, and thicke, being very fat, for I haue weighed many of their tayles flayed from the Butchers, and they haue waighed ten, eleuen, and twelue pound waight, and throughout all Barbarie and Turkie, they haue plenty of theſe beaſts, and alſo all kind of beaſts that we haue in England. There liue many Gréekes in all parts throughout the Turkes Dominions, but in great bondage and pouertie: they are good Chriſtians, abhorring the Idolatry of Rome, and obſeruing the ſame computation for Chriſtmaſſe and other feſtiuals, that we doe in England.\nAlſo there are Jewes in all parts of Turkie and Barbary, and all parts of Chriſtendome, England excepted: yet though they be thus diſperſed throughout moſt parts of the world, liuing in extreame ſlauery, yet ſhall you not ſee one Jew begge his bread. One thing I haue greatly maruelled at, that a Jew is reſpected more in Chriſtendome, then with the Turks: for the Turks (as you haue heard) deteſts him aboue any Nation, tying him to a notable and knowne marke, or manner of apparrell, and yeelding him no Law or right, eyther againſt Turke or Chriſtian: whereas, contrarywiſe, in Chriſtendome, he is tyed to no manner of weare, but may goe in what ſhape he liſts: and for Law, by reaſon of his wealth, hee ſhall ſooner haue right done to him then a Chriſtian: wherefore in my minde, the Turke greatly in this condemnes the Popiſh Chriſtian: for it is an ordinary ſaying with them, tha\n•\n if a Jew had put Mahomet to death, nay, but touched the hem of his garment violently, they would not haue left one of the race of them aliue, nor yet any thing, or building vnraced, that might procure their memory. But in Chriſtendome they are ſuffered to build Sinagogues, and to vſe their Religion publikely. But I beſeech the Almightie God that this our Land of England may neuer be defiled, eyther by Pope, Turke, or Jew.\n            \n\n               IX. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Sicillia.\n\nSIcillia is a famous Iland of the Spaniards, hauing manyDiſtant \n•\nro\n•\n England \n〈…〉\n\n\n•\neague\n•\n. worthie Cities vpon it. This Iland is in bigneſſe ſeauen hundred miles about, very fruitfull, and plentifull of all things, as Silke, Fleſh, and Fiſh, Corne, Wine, and Oyle, with great ſtore of Fruit. This Iland is gouerned by a Vizeroy, vnder the king of Spaine: his chiefs abiding is at Palerm\n•\n, or Mercina, two famous Cittes, but his chiefeſt reſidence is at Palerma. This City lyeth in low ground, hauing a Mountaine néere it, called Monta Pellagrune. This Citie is very\n\n\npopulous, being rich of Marchandize and wealthy Marchants. At this Citie I haue beene very often in the time of my ſla\n\n•••\nte in the Dukes Gallies. Alſo, néere this Citie there is a Towne called Trappany, in which Towne there is a Monaſtarie, wherein they affirme that the Pillar of Salt that Lots Wiſe was turned vnto, comming out of Sodome is. They profeſſe the Romiſh Religion through out this Iland both men and Women, ſpeaking the Italian tongue generally, as many as be borne in the Iland, and are called Sicillianes. Mercina being another famous Citie, lyeth cloſe vpon the Sea, and is ſcituated vpon high ground, vnder the foote of a great Mountayne. This City is ſtrongly fortified and planted with O\n••••\nnce: alſo there is great ſtore of Gallies and Shipping belonging to this place, which doth much offend the Turke, \n••\nt chiefely they are employed in Marchandiye. This high Mountayne that hangs ouer the Citie is called Mungebella, and ſtandeth in the Eaſt-part of this Iland, the top of it burning continually both night and day, and by reaſon of the fierceneſſe of the fire, hath conſumed many Uillages. The reaſon of this fire is a Brimſtone, or a Sulphure Mine, which being high, is (as all men imagine) ſet a fire by the heate of the Sunne, as the Iland Strambula is, which continually burneth: and many other high places more that I haue ſéene, as Mount Aetna, the pike of Teneriffe a Southward Iland, and many others, &c.\n               Unto this Citie Mercina belongs a ſtraight entrance by Sea, commonly called the \n•\nale of Mercina it lyeth betwixt the Land of Sicillia and Calabria, very dangerous to paſſe through for any Ship, except they are very well experimented. For my part I know this place well, being often there in the \n••\nme of my ſlauerie.\n\n\n               X. The Deſcription and diſcouery of \n\n••\nggadore.\n\nMVggadore is an Iland of the Moores, and lyeth néere the\n\n•\n\n\n〈…〉\n\n\n〈…〉\n England \n〈…〉\n\n\n〈…〉\n\n Lan\n•\n o\n•\n\n\n\n•\narbary, without the Straights, not farre from\n\n\nthe Lands of the Kings of Feſſe and Morrocco. Th\n•\ns Il\n•\nnd is not inhabited, but very barren, being all Rocks by the \n〈…〉\n ſide, and very ſmoothe on the to\n•\n, and full of buſhes, \n〈…〉\n Pidgions doe b\n•\neede in great ſtore: we held it nothing \n〈…〉\n\n\n〈…〉\n ſixe or eight in company together into the Iland, and \n〈…〉\n\n\n〈…〉\n the ſpace of thrée houres, twentie dozens of Pidgions \n〈…〉\n with vs. Betwixt the Maine and this Iland there is very good riding for a Shippe. Alſo, the Moores will bring out \n••\n the Maine Land ſuch Uictuals as they haue to re\n••••\ne o\n•\nr wants, as Mutton, Beefe, \n•\nc. The Moores of this Countr\n••\n are very deceitfull and trecherous: their cloathing is but very naked and thinne, for they weare but one ſlat of thin\n••\n F\n•\nan\n•••\n wherewith they couer their breſts, backs and p\n••\nu\n•\ne parts and as for their armes, legs, and thighes, they \n••\ne na\n•\ned of them: the ſayd Garment, or piece of Flane\n•\nl, they call \n•\n Barnooſe. In this Countrey of Barbary there is great ſtore of Sugar-canes, and Sugar made, as they in Braz\n•\ne. Sometimes in this Countrey there is Amber-greaſe found, but the cunning of the Moores makes a great deale counterfaite. I came to this Iland in a Carnell of Plymouth, Maſter Edward Decon of the ſaide Towne being Maſter of her: Moores comming oftentimes aboord of vs, where they were kindly entertayned; but they returned our kindneſſe in this manner▪ Setting of the chiefeſt, with many more of them aſhorem our Boate, wherein ſixe Engliſh men rowed them aſhore▪ they being all a Land, our Boat was aground, then one of our men ſtept out of the Boat, vp to the knées in water, and by ſtrength would haue ſet the Boate off from the Land, which as \n•\noone as they eſpyed him out of the Boate, they tooke h\n••\nd of him▪ and drew him a Land, where they cut all his cloathes off his backe, and deuided them in péeces amongſt them, carrying the man ſtarke naked vp into the Countrey, ſaying tha\n••\ne ſhould neuer haue him againe except they had twentie French Crownes for his ranſome, which newes the Boace brought preſently aboord, (which being in vaine to ſt\n•••\ne with them \n•\née gaue them, and receiued the man naked, hauing no further dealing with them.\n            \n\n               XI. The Deſcription and diſcouery of Candy.\n\nCAndy is a famous Iland of the Venetians, very fruitfull,Diſtant from England \n•••\n leagues yeelding great ſtore of Wine and Oyle, and all other things plentifull. This Iland is very high and long, poynting Eaſt and Weſt: the North-ſide of it very pleaſant, with great ſtore of Gardens and Uineyards, and ſuch like: but very barren to the Southward-ſide, with great Rocks, Cliffs, and Mountaynes, which part is inhabited by poore Gréekes: and alſo there are many ſmall Ilands vnder theſe Cliffs, inhabited likewiſe by Gréekes, as Chriſtiana and Godza, with others more. Theſe Gréekes liue all together in bondage to the Uenetians. The North-ſide of this Iland is inhabited by Italians, and ſome Jewes. There are two very fayre Cities: (viz.) Candia, and Acony, theſe Cities are inhabited moſt with Uenetians, ſtrongly fortified and planted with Ordnance. Theſe Cities lye right againſt the entring of the Arches of Appellican, which goeth to Conſtantinople, where the Great Turke continues, receiuing tribute of the Duke of Venice for this Iland, and other parts, for the Uenetian is tributary to the Great Turke. Alſo the Great Turke kéepes him in ſubiection by Land and Sea, neither dare the Uenetian ioyne their forces with any Chriſtian, at any time whenſoeuer a Fléete of Gallies and Shipps is ſet forth againſt the Turke, yet the Duke of Uenice hath twiſe as many Gallies as any Chriſtian Prince whatſoeuer, which he doth employ, ſome of them in Marchandize, hauing continuall trading both with Chriſtian and Turke, and ſome of his Gallies continually lieth about the entring of the Gulph of Venice, about the Iland of Zant and Saphlany, and the ſmall Iland of the Strauales, and néere about Madona: theſe parts doe they defend from any Chriſtian men of warre, or Chriſtian Gallies, or eyther Gallies or Briggantéens of the Turkes that ſhall approach néere vnto theſe parts, in the manner and faſhion of\n\n\nmen of Warre: and oftentimes the ſayd Gallies doe take both Chriſtian and Turke, making Slaues of the men, or elſe chopping off of their heads; for it is lawfull for him ſo to doe, by the concluſion betwixt Him, the Chriſtian, and Turke, taking them within twentie leagues compaſſe of the entrance of his Gulph, but not in any other part of the Sea, without the ſaid compaſſe.\n            \n\n               XII. The Deſcription of Morria.\n\nMOrria is a ſmall low Iland, lying in the Riuer of Amazones,\n\n\n〈…〉\n\n the higheſt part of the Weſt Indies. This Iland is altogether inhabited by Women, hauing no Mankinde amongſt them: they goe altogether naked, vſing Bow and Arrowes for the killing of their owne foode: the hayre of their heads is long, and their Breſts hang low: and whereas many here in England doe imagine that they haue the right Breſt ſeared, or cut off, it is no ſuch matter as now▪ what hath béene in times paſt I know not: for this of mine owne knowledge, I haue ſeene fortie, fiftie, or threeſcore of them together, each of them bearing Bow and Arrowes in their hands, going along by the Sea-ſide; and when they eſpyed a Fiſh, they ſhoote at it, and ſtrike it, and ſo throwing downe their Bowes, they leap into the water after their Arrowes, and bring the Fiſh aland, faſtned to the Arrow: and \n•\no in all other things as well the dreſſing of their meate, as their lodging and cuſtomes, they reſemble and imitate the Indians of the Riuer of Amazons, as you heard before in that diſcourſe. But ſome \n••\n theſe Women doe vſe to beare their Children vpon their backs, in this manner: They take a yeere of the unde of \n•\n Trée, and with the one end thereof they faſten the Childes hunmes, and about the arme-pits and ſhoulders with the other, and ſo hang him on their backs like a Tinkers Budger, and caſt vp the breſt to him ouer the ſhoulder. The reaſon wherefore this Iland is inhabited by Women onely, \n•\ns this\n\n\nOne Moneth in the yéere, the Men from each ſide of the Maine Land comes in their Canowes, ouer to the Iland, euery Man matching himſelfe with a Woman, liuing there a Moneth: and what men Children they finde there, they carry away with them; and the Woman Children they leaue behinde with the Mothers. And this is their vſe once a yéere, whereby this Iland is altogether inhabited by Women. There is one thing more to be wondred at, that I haue alſo ſéene, that is to ſay, very good Oyſters and Muskles growing vpon trées, for I haue eaten my part of many an hundred of them. And for your better vnderſtanding how they grow, you ſhall know that the Trées ſtand néere the Sea ſide, and at euery full tyde the bowes hang into the Sea a fadome, or a fadome and a halfe, ſo that when the tyde goeth out, they are found hanging in great cluſters vpon the branches, like Barnacles to the ſide of a ſhip, and at the comming in of the tyde, they receiue their moyſture.\n            \nFINIS.\n", "image_url": "A19936/00005.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

{"sentence": "\nI ſhall begin at the latter end of his Speech, where he has theſe words:\n\n\n\n1. I take it to be clear, That my Religion is the ſole cauſe, which moved my Accuſers to charge me with the Crime, for which upon their Evidence I am adjudged to die; and that my being of that Religion, which I here profefs, was the only ground which could give them any hope to be believ'd, or which could move my Jury to believe the Evidence of ſuch men.\n\n2. I have had not only a Pardon, but alſo great Advantages, as to Preferments, and Eſtates offer'd unto me, ſince this Judgement was against me, in caſe I would have forſaken my Religion, and owned my ſelf guilty of the Crime charged againſt me, and charged the ſame Crimes upon others: But bleſſed be my God, who by his grace hath preſerved me from yielding to thoſe Temptations, and ſtrengthned me rather to chooſe this Death, than to ſtain my Soul with ſin, and to charge others, against truth, with Crimes, of which I do not know that any perſon is guilty.\n\n\n\n\nAs to the firſt, Though Mr. Langhorn has ſaid it, no perſon will believe him, though in the Speech of a dying man. That he was only charg'd with Crimes, (though they were moſt evidently prov'd againſt him) which had no other ground or foundation, but from the venom and malice of his Accuſers, and they no other Reaſon for this ſo great malice, than that he was a profeſſor of the Roman Catholick Religion.\nFirſt, It cannot appear rational, that their malice, as he pleaſes to miſcal it, ſhould be levell'd particularly againſt him, either as to his Perſon or Religion, being a Roman Catholick, ſince thoſe of that Religion have all along been moſt tenderly and mercifully dealt withal by the ſuperiour Magiſtrates, ſo long as they liv'd peaceably and quietly under Government, and did not deſign and act Treaſon againſt the Prince, or Deſtruction to the People, and Subverſion of the Government. Nor was there after the Gunpowder-Treaſon, any Roman Catholick proſecuted purely for his Religion; nay, thoſe who did incur the Penal Statutes, as they were Prieſts, were yet more favourably us'd than perhaps they merited in themſelves. So that to offer ſuch a criminal Charge and proſecution, either againſt Mr. Langhorn, or any perſon elſe, and at the ſame time really falſe, from a difference in Religion only, is no practice amongſt Proteſtants, nor ever was, but is notoriouſly known to be allowed, encouraged, and commanded, in the Principles and Practices of the Papiſts, againſt all (and with the extreameſt ſeverities) who are of a different opinion from the Roman Church.\nOf this, in Queen Maries Reign, we have voluminous Inſtances, of their bloody Cruelties againſt Proteſtants, not for Treaſon againſt the Prince, nor for endeavouring the Subverſion of Government, but only for being Proteſtants and not Papiſts.\nSecondly, It is no wonder if he charges his Accuſers with malice, and that with ſo much confidence and untruth; for now he proceeds to as high Reflections againſt his Governours, That he was offer'd by them not only a Pardon to his Life, but Promotions, and all worldly Advantages, would he have deſerted his Religion, and acknowledged thoſe Crimes to be true he ſtood charg'd withal, and charge them upon others, who by his inference muſt be ſuppoſed innocent.\nThat Mr. Langhorn, from the unbounded Clemency of his Prince to all his Subjects, might preſume upon the ſame mercy others have received, I do believe; but then upon thoſe terms on which God Almighty pardons, a ſincere Confeſſion, and humble Contrition. Or if ever ſuch a mercy was offer'd to him, never was it more abus'd, never more betray'd; when what was offer'd, was in no other ſence, and for no other reaſon, than that he would diſcover the naked truth of what he knew, what he acted, that thoſe Miſchiefs which impend over King and Country, might be prevented, and they who were thoſe deviliſh Engines, either by inventing or promoting of them, and yet lay undiſcover'd, might be known, and brought to publick Juſtice. I could not have believed, that ſo great mercy could have met with ſo baſe ingratitude, that after ſo noble and generous Offers, which, he ſays, were tendred to him, he ſhould make returns of ſo high injuſtice, and place the reaſon of thoſe merciful Offers to no other account, than that by preſerving of him, and his charging of others, who were innocent, they might have a fair opportunity and colour of Juſtice, to maſſacre the whole Flock of Roman Catholick Profeſſors. As no moderate perſon, or who is Maſter of common ſenſe, but can eaſily diſcern the malicious Interpretation he has made of theſe merciful Tenders, ſo will he at the ſame time confeſs, he has moſt deſervedly ſuffer'd for thoſe notorious Treaſons he was found guilty of, and condemned for.\nAs to the other parts and members of his Speech, he ſays no more in ſence, than what was ſaid before by the five Jeſuits, his Predeceſſors in puniſhment; only as theirs ſavour'd more of Oratory, his anſwerable to his profeſſion; is penn'd with that complication and repetition of words to the ſame ſence, in Lawyers phraſe, that had it been, as his laſt Speech, his laſt Will and Teſtament, it could not have been with more care and regard to his true ſence and meaning, transfer'd to Poſterity. This may ſeem a very prevalent and tempting Argument, to believe, that as he particularly ſtudied by his expreſſions to be rightly underſtood, ſo he did at the ſame time ſpeak the naked truth from the bottom of his Soul, without any fallacy or colluſion whatſoever.\nThat he did not ſo, the proof in Court ſo evident againſt him, is a moſt convincing Argument.\nThe next Quere to be anſwered, is, How he, or any perſon or perſons can expect to be ſaved, when at the inſtant of death, they do ſo obſtinately deny the truth of what in their Conſciences they are convinced is ſo, and not only this, but to imprecate eternal puniſhment upon their departing Souls, if they have not faithfully and ſincerely diſcharged themſelves of the truth to their utmoſt knowledge.\nThe Reaſons why they do ſo peremptorily deny all Treaſons, Murders, or whatever may be, or is poſitively and directly prov'd againſt them, is, in that they receive their Abſolution upon ſuch terms, that they are obliged to die not only concealing them, but utterly denying; otherwiſe they not only forfeit the whole benefit of their Abſolution, but are ipſo facto excluded the Pale of the Church, and, as Renegadoes, all future hopes of Salvation. It has been publickly reported by a perſon concerned in the Murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, that could he in Priſon have procured an opportunity for a Prieſt to come to him, and to have abſolv'd him, he would never have acknowledg'd, what he has ſince publickly confeſt before Authority, though he had been courted, and offer'd a greater temptation, than Mr. Langhornhad, an earthly Crown for his Reward; ſo great power and awe hath the Abſolution of the Prieſt, over the Senſe and Conſciences of their Votaries, and ſtricteſt Profeſſors.\n            Secondly, From the Doctrine of their Church, to Equivocate is no ſin, no not at the hour of Death, if it is to an Heretick, or for the Service of the Catholick Cauſe: This, ſufficient proofs from their own Authors, have avowed to the World. Cauſabon, pag. 202. ſpeaking of Garnet's Opinion of the lawfulneſs of Equivocation at the hour of Death, in his Papers communicated to King James, ſays, Since it is lawful (and he concludes it ſo) to uſe this in the courſe of his Life, why may it not be us'd alſo by a dying man?\n\nNor do they only Equivocate, but by compleating the ſence in their own thoughts, by a mental Reſervation, paralogize upon their Auditors, Equivocate upon their own Equivocation; of ſo doubtful ſence are their beſt expreſſions in the extreameſt Agonies of Death.\nTo conclude, Though I cannot heartily believe this to have been the genuine product of Mr. Langhorn's thoughts at the hour of Death, but rather penn'd by the Wily Prieſt, to cajoll the World, and conciliate a Reputation to that Cauſe, which has of late ſuffer'd ſo much; yet admit it to be ſo, I muſt agree, though a profound Lawyer, I am not of his ſence, but think his laſt, the worſt Conveyance that e're was drawn.\nFINIS.\n", "image_url": "A25560/00002.000.001.left.png", "label": "0"}

I could not have believed, that ſo great mercy could have met with ſo baſe ingratitude, that after ſo noble and generous Offers, which, he ſays, were tendred to him, he ſhould make returns of ſo high injuſtice, and place the reaſon of thoſe merciful Offers to no other account, than that by preſerving of him, and his charging of others, who were innocent, they might have a fair opportunity and colour of Juſtice, to maſſacre the whole Flock of Roman Catholick Profeſſors. As no moderate perſon, or who is Maſter of common ſenſe, but can eaſily diſcern the malicious Interpretation he has made of theſe merciful Tenders, ſo will he at the ſame time confeſs, he has moſt deſervedly ſuffer'd for thoſe notorious Treaſons he was found guilty of, and condemned for.\nAs to the other parts and members of his Speech, he ſays no more in ſence, than what was ſaid before by the five Jeſuits, his Predeceſſors in puniſhment; only as theirs ſavour'd more of Oratory, his anſwerable to his profeſſion; is penn'd with that complication and repetition of words to the ſame ſence, in Lawyers phraſe, that had it been, as his laſt Speech, his laſt Will and Teſtament, it could not have been with more care and regard to his true ſence and meaning, transfer'd to Poſterity. This may ſeem a very prevalent and tempting Argument, to believe, that as he particularly ſtudied by his expreſſions to be rightly underſtood, ſo he did at the ſame time ſpeak the naked truth from the bottom of his Soul, without any fallacy or colluſion whatſoever.\nThat he did not ſo, the proof in Court ſo evident againſt him, is a moſt convincing Argument.\nThe next Quere to be anſwered, is, How he, or any perſon or perſons can expect to be ſaved, when at the inſtant of death, they do ſo obſtinately deny the truth of what in their Conſciences they are convinced is ſo, and not only this, but to imprecate eternal puniſhment upon their departing Souls, if they have not faithfully and ſincerely diſcharged themſelves of the truth to their utmoſt knowledge.\nThe Reaſons why they do ſo peremptorily deny all Treaſons, Murders, or whatever may be, or is poſitively and directly prov'd againſt them, is, in that they receive their Abſolution upon ſuch terms, that they are obliged to die not only concealing them, but utterly denying; otherwiſe they not only forfeit the whole benefit of their Abſolution, but are ipſo facto excluded the Pale of the Church, and, as Renegadoes, all future hopes of Salvation. It has been publickly reported by a perſon concerned in the Murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, that could he in Priſon have procured an opportunity for a Prieſt to come to him, and to have abſolv'd him, he would never have acknowledg'd, what he has ſince publickly confeſt before Authority, though he had been courted, and offer'd a greater temptation, than Mr. Langhorn", "image_url": "A25560/00002.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

For it has appeared by the Evidence that has been given of this late Horrid Conſpiracy, that after the Diſappointment that was given by the Providence of God, by the Fire at New-Market, to the meeting at the Rye, the Gentleman was one of the Perſons that actually engaged to go on upon the Kings haſty coming to Town then, and to deſtroy him by the way as he came to Town.

Juſt.\nWe are not to meddle at all with the Evidence, Mr. Attorney; that is not our buſineſs; here is an Outlawry, upon this Outlawry he is Attainted, we have nothing more to do, but to do the Duty of the Court upon this Record before us, to Award Execution upon that Attainder, and we muſt give a Rule for it. If the King will be pleaſed to do for Sir Tho. Armſtrong what he did for Holloway, and indulge him a Tryal, and wave th' Out-lawry, with all our hearts. We are not diſpoſers of his Grace and Favour, but the Miniſters of his Juſtice. If the King will pardon him, he may; that is not our buſineſs; but all we have to do upon what is before us, is to conſider the Record, and what the Priſoner ſays againſt our awarding of Execution. We have Conſidered whether this be a Yielding within the Proviſo of this Statute, and we think it not, nor can be, by any means.\n", "image_url": "B04842/00002.000.001.left.png", "label": "0"}

To wooe a Mayd.\n               \nFAire Mayd, the opportunity of time and place (none being by to over-heare us) doth invite mée to diſcover my affection. For ſince nothing can be determined in loves affaires without conſent of both parties, I meane now ſo acquaint you with my deſire: Which is, that ſince my heart hath made choice of you in the way of marriage, you would bée pleaſed to receive my love with like affection: I know I might have delivered my mind in more choice and eloquent words, but beléeve me, that love is trueſt, which ſpeakes plaineſt. Now the reaſons that induce mée to ſéeke your lovs, are the vertuous qualities which adorne your mind; whoſe amiable and lovely beauty makes my heart burne with a chaſt affection: Thinke not therefore that any foule deſires move me to become a Suitor to y\n•\nu, nor am I haſty for marriage; for if you pleaſe to grant mée your love, I will ſtay your leaſure to appoint the day to conſummate our happineſſe. I am a young pleader at the Barre of affection, and therefore hope you will not diſcourage me in my firſt ſuit, but rather ſince my cauſe is full of love, will at laſt give me a happy anſwere. Fearfull diſtruſt I know doth plead againſt me, and tels you how Maides have béene deceived by flattering men, who have onely made a Complement of love to obtaine their own deſires But alas (faire Maide) condemne not all becauſe ſome have béene falſe hearted: for I dare promiſe for my ſelfe, that the ſtreame of my affection ſlowing from your vertues ſhall ever kéepe a conſtant courſe. For the ſeale of your love is ſo déepely imprinted in my heart, that no time can weare it out: and therefore be aſſured, that till you ceaſe to be vertuous (which I know is impoſſible) I can never ceaſe to love you. And thus (ſwéet Mayd) I have unclaſped the volumne of my ſecret thoughts, wherein you may read by faire intents, which are onely to obtaine your love. and ioyne your heart néerer to mine by the inviolable Bond of marriage. Let me deſire you therefore to unfold your lips, and give a favouring. anſwer to my languiſhing hopes.\n            \n\n               2. The Maids anſwer\n               SIr, your language is ſo full of chaſt affection, and delivered with ſo much mooving paſſion, that had my fancy hitherto entertained a thought of love, you had certainly prevailed over the weakeneſſe of a Mayds reſiſtance. But alas, your love is a ſtranger to my heart; and therfore blame me not if I dare not receive it as a plaine gueſt, till I have conſulted with my owne thoughts. Sudden conſent is alwaies held dangerous, and is ſtill followed by repentance. And therefore give me leave to conſider your late motion, & I wil ſtudy your ſatisfectiō in my anſwer: which if it proove not to your content, yet it ſhall expreſſe my thankfulneſſe for that love you beare me. In the meane time I muſt diſmiſſe my ſelfe from your company, for I feare my mother hath tooke notice of our conference, and ſo for my abrupt departure (if it be any breach of manners) I muſt relye on your parton.\n            \n\n               3. To urge a ſuite the ſecondtime.\n               THe next day, repairing to the former place, I ſpyed theſe two Lovers lying on a bank of Flowers, ſo that uſing the friendſhip of ſome buſhes to hide me, I lay downe, and ſo u\n•\nſeene over-heard the former Sutor renewing his ſute in theſe words: Faire Mayd, now is the time that your promiſe hath ingag'd you to give an anſwer to my doubtfull feares: and now I am to receive my ſentence from you, which I hope ſhall be full of comfort, ſince the greateſt offence wherewith you can charge my heart, is onely this, that I love you: and therefore I came to this place full of hope to be made happy by your anſwer, ſo let mée returne full of ioy by your frée conſenting to my former motion▪ But what néede I doubt, or afflict my ſelfe with vaine feares? ſince I doe reads ſome comfort in your chéerefull countinance, which caynot, like a cruell Iudge, ſmile and condemne at once M\n•\n heart doth preſage, that during my abſence, Cupid hath wrought in your heart a good opinion of mée, which if you are unwilling to let your tongue confeſſe, leſt a buſh ſhould ſpread it ſelf upon your chéeke: I am content to take you\n•\n ſilence for my anſwer, ſo you will ſuffer me, ac\n•\n\ncording to the rules of love, to interpret that ſilence for conſent, But ſay, I ſée your lips are ready to prepare my doome, and therefore with patience I will expect my ſentence either of life or death, ſince it is in your power to raiſe mee up, or caſt me downe.\n            \n\n               4. The Mayds anſwer.\n               SIr, I perceive the love that you profeſſe unto me can receive no alteration by time: for I was in good hope, that your two dayes abſence would have inform'd your iudgement, to place your love on ſome more worthy choyce. But now ſince you are bent ſtill to proſecute your former ſuite, and will not beléeve me when I \n•\nell you how much I want of thoſe v\n••\ntues which you attribute to me, I hope you will not \n•\nlame mée if I conſent to your former motion: for I beléeve you love me in the way of mar\n\n••\nge, and in that aſſuran\n•\n I grant you my love \n••\naine.\n\n\n               5. The Lovers reply.\n               IT is a grant that makes me happy, and now let me ſeale my patent with this kiſſe, for you have given me your love, and with it a little world of happineſſe: So that there remaines nothing, but that we appoint our wedding day, which I will not haſten through any forward deſire of mine owne: For ſince I have obtain'd your promiſe for marriage, I doe beléeve that our hearts are already married in heaven, before a Congregation of Angels, which the Church ſhal but only publiſh and make known to the world. And ſo bidding adieu to vaine Complements, which onely became mée as a Sutor, I hope I may now ſay you are mine, as I am yours.\n\n\n               6. Maſter Brainleſſe his wooing of Miſtriſſe Barbara.\n               SWéete Miſtreſſe Barbara, I beſéech you not to be barbarous unto mée. For our Father\n•\n have made the match already, and I am now come to w\n••\ne you: for I feele the mouth o\n•\n my affection begin to water at thée, ſo th\n••\n there muſt be ſome ſpéedy remedy found out t\n•\n allay my burning heat; for if I looke, but \n••\n your pretty foote, I féele my heart begin to riſ\n•\n beneath my girdle, that ſure I thinke thou haſt ſome ſpirit about thée, which doth bewitch mée, but I hope ere long, you ſhall finde that I have a ſpirit too, which if it take after my Mother, it may be a devilliſh ſpirit for any thing I know, for I am ſure ſhee was an arrant ſhrew. But I love no long diſcourſe, and therefore I would entreat you,\n               \nThat you would looke upon my wounded heart▪\n\nAnd with your favour helpe to eaſe my ſmart.\n\n\n\n               7. To excuſe ſome inconfiderate ſpeeches to a Gentlewoman.\n               IF formerly (ſwéet Miſtris) I have throwne out any words inconſiderately, which might move your anger, I beſéech you pardon them, or if my tongue have wronged my heart by haſty ſpeaking, attribute it to my raſhneſſe, not want of love: for I recant thoſe wordes that have mooved your iuſt diſdaine, and ſince they cannot be recalled, let your wiſedome and ſwéetneſſe of nature be ſhewed in pardoning, as my folly was in offending: Let theſe words excuſe my treſpaſſe, for I know you are full of mercy, and cannot long deny a pardon to him that ſues for it with teares, though in a greater matter. But I ſée you turne away from mée as if my words ſéeking to excuſe my former words did ſtill offend you, and therefore I will beg ſome favour from you in theſe few verſes which I made upon this occaſion.\n               \nIf that my tongue (faire Nymph) hath ſaid amiſſe,\nThe ſame for pardon now a Sutor is,\nOr for it ſelfe if it too weakely pleade,\nMy lips on its beh\n•\nlfe thus intercede:\nThus ſue, thus beg, and begging will not leave,\nTill they a pardon ſ\n•\nal'd from yours receive,\nAnd while my kiſſes beg, O happy me,\nIf I might ever ſuch a begger be.\n\n\n\n               8. To welcome one home.\n               SIr, we have often wiſhed your compony at home, and now you have made us happy in our deſires, by your ſafe ret\n•\nrne, to bid you welcom is but the common rode way of friendſhip, and therefore I would f\n•\nine ſpeake ſomething that might ſet forth my love more fully, but indéed I find that all words are tóo meane to expreſſe the ioy tha\n•\n my heart conceives at your happy returne, Wée were fearfull and ſolicitons, leaſt ſome misfortune might befall you in the way But now we muſt confeſſe we owe a ſacrifice of thankes to Heaven for protecting you in your iourney, and bringing you backe againe unto us, to whom I dare pr\n•\nſume you are as welcome as health to the ficke man, or a calme to the Weather-beaten Mar\n•\niner. To conclude, I could bid you welcome a thouſand times, and yet thinke thoſe welcomes too few for ſince my love to you is infinite, I muſt néeds ſay you are infinitely welcome.\n            \n\n               9. To perſwade by way of Councell.\n               SIr, were I worthy to counſell you of whom I am more fit to learne than to adviſe, I would perſwade you, to leave off that ill company, to which I finde you are too much addicted For I profeſſe unto you, my counſell is directed to no other aime, but your owne good, and to entreate you to be kind unto your ſelfe, and not to diſgrace your parentage and birth, by frequenting ſuch baſe and ignoble company, who onely deſire to infect you with their vices, and who like ſhaddowes onely depend upon the Sunne of your fortune: which if once it be darkened by the aclipſe of adverſity, you ſhall finde that you who before could number ſo many friends, ſhall then be left alone to deplore your owne folly, in thinking that thoſe could be friends unto you, who are not friends unto themſelves: for having by their owne laviſh profuſion ſpent their owne eſtates, all their purpoſe now is to winde you into the ſome Labyrinth of miſery, if there thou have already entred into the intricate wayes of vice, let my counſell ſerve like Adriadne's clew of thred to guide your ſteps, backe againe into the way of vertue, from which you have too farre already wandred. But perhaps I ſhall obtaine your hatred, and by ſéeking to reclaime your errours, ſhall there by loſe your favour, yet however, I ſh\n•\nll expreſſe the duty and office of a friend: for while I ſee you run theſe wilde, and ruinous courſes, though I am your friend, I will not be your flatterer.\n            \n\n               10. To entreate a courteſie\n               SIr, you ſhall oblige mée to you, by adding one new favour to your former courteſies, for ſo it is, that my buſineſſe will miſcarry, unleſſe I obtaine your aſſiſtance, which if you pleaſe to grant mée, you ſhall not onely binde me unto you by the reſ\n•\ne\n•\ns of duty and obſervance, but ſhall alſo expreſſe your ſelfe the miracle of true friendſhip, I confeſſe I am unwilling to be troubleſome unto \n•\nou, but yet ſuch is the commanding neceſſity of my affaires, that I muſt aſſume an unwonted boldneſſe to petition your favour and aſſiſtance in my behalfe.\n\n\n               11. The anſwer.\n               SIr, you may command mée; for I am ſo wholly devoted to your ſervice, that you may aſſure your ſelfe, I can deny you no requeſt which lies within the circle or compaſſe of my power. For my heart is yours, and therefore what good I am able to doe you (either in this or any other kind) you may promiſe your ſelfe) being indéed glad to be imployed in any ſervice that concernes you, ſo that (to the ability of a poore friend) I ſhall be ev\n•\nr ready to ſecond your deſires with my beſt endeavours. Command me therefore when you pleaſe, and you ſhall finde mée your ready ſervant, for I languiſh with a deſire to doe you ſome courteſie that may expreſſe that friendſhip and love I owe you, which hath hitherto laine dead in me, for want of opportunity to demonſtrate and make it evident to the eyes of the World, by ſome friendly office.\n\n\n               12. To bid a Bride good morrow.\n               MIſtris Bride, I wiſh the ioyes of love may be ſtill multiplyed upon you. Nay bluſh not, for it is no ſhame to doe the Common wealth ſervice, by bringing a race of Souldiers into the World. I know this night you have endevoured for it, but we muſt ſée the fruit hereafter: All this I wiſh is, that your Husband and you may live together like a contented paire, happy in each other. What now? Wéeping? I hope you will not give ſuch an example to the Mayds, or ſo diſable your Bridegroom, as to ſhew any ſigues of griefe or ſorrow on the following morning to your Wedding day. If you have parted with a long preſerved ioy to night, yet comfort your ſelfe in your loſſes, for there are many Mayds would have béen glad of your place, and thanke you too, But I have no art in Complements, and therefore in a word, I wiſh you all ioy.\n            \n\n               13. To bid a Bridegroome good morrow.\n               MAſter Bridegroom, I muſt congratulate the ioyes of Marriage, and wiſh they may increaſe daily to both your comforts: you have enioyed to night a happineſſe which my knowledge did never yet arive at▪ and therefore it is unpoſſible for me to gueſſe it; however I doe not envy, but wiſh you al happineſſe with your faire choyce. And though by your heavy eye, I diſcerne you have not tooke your due of reſt to night, yet you may take it out the next, for I could wiſh my Bedde were troubled with ſuch fleas, on that condition I ſlept not theſe two nights. All that I can wiſh is this, that no fatall time day, or houre, may produce a change or alteration in your affections: But that you may live like Turtle Doves you ioying in her and ſhée with mutuall delight making you the obiect of all her happineſſe, that ſo your marriage may proove a merri-age.\n            \n\n               14. At the firſt meeting of a friend.\n               SIr, you are well met and moſt happily returned; for fame hath given out a ſiniſter report, that you were miſcarried in your iourney, but I am glad the old proverbe is true, that fame is often a lyer. I pray let a pint of Wine be the Scrivener to renew the bonds of our friendſhip, for I am even full of ioy to behold you, and my heart would bid you welcome in better phraſe, but that I want words to expreſſe the integrity and truth of my affection. I have forgot all this while to enquire of our friends health, my thoughts were ſo wholy buſied to bid you welcome. But I hope, Sir, they are well.\n\n\n               15. The other friends anſwer\n               SIr, your friends are all well, and are m\n•\nndful of you in the remembrance of their love. Neither am I leſſe ioyfull at our fortunate méeting, which is a happineſſe I have long wiſhed for; and though my tongue cannot interpret the inward ioy of my heart, yet I would not have you thinke that love is leaſt; which hath leaſt expreſſion of it ſelfe. For a full veſſell yéelds no ſound, and a heart full of affection cannot ſo eaſily expreſs it ſelfe in a ſmooth way of Complements: in a word I am heartily glad to ſée you and to ſay more, were but to ſpeake the ſame in more words.\n            \n\n               16. To preſent a gift to a Mayd.\n               FAire Mayde, I would deſire you to accept this ſmall Ring, as an embleme of my affection, which like a circle ſhall be ever endleſſe. I know it is unworthy your acceptance, y\n•\nt vaine out of the graciouſneſſe of your humility, to receive this unworthy pledge of that love and ſervice which I ſhall ever owe you, till time ſhall inable me to expreſſe my love in ſome more worthy gift. And if at any time this toy doe chance to draw downe your eye unto your finger, if you pleaſe to remember me thereby and thinke on me who hath de voted my ſelfe to your ſervice, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe the leſſe unhappy in my abſence; though indéed till I returne againe, I ſhall be able to relliſh no taſte of comfort, ſince all my ioy is to enjoy your company: but my buſineſſe doth enforce me away, ſo that leaving this with you as a memento of my affection, I take my leave with as ſad a heart as ever lover parted with his Miſtreſſe.\n            \n\n               17. To bid a friend farewell.\n               SIr, I am ſo unwilling to be deprived of your ſwéete ſociety, and ſo ſorty to looſe the fruition of your good company, that my heart will hardly permit mée to take my leave of you, yet ſince the neceſſity of your occaſions doth enforce us to part, I can but wiſh you a proſperous iourney, and with my prayers daily ſolicite heaven for your ſafe returne. I will not bu\n•\nthen your memory with ſeverall commendations, but onely deſire you to remember my love and ſervice in generall, to all our friends in the Countrey. This is all I require of you, and ſince, though unwilling, wée muſt endure your abſence from us, I will promiſe in the meane time, to bée your Beadeſ-man to pray for your happy iourney and will onely kéepe ſo much of my heart as may kéepe me alive, the other half ſhal go with you. Now I ſee why death is called departing, for departing of friends is a ſhort death; give me your hand, the ancient embleme of affection, and I pray be carefull of your ſelfe, ſince in your welfare conſiſts the welfare of all your friends. And ſo farewell.\n            \n\n               18. To entreat a courteſy of a ſtranger\n               SIr, though I am unknowne unto you, yet the report of your knowne courteſ\n•\n makes me bold to preferre a ſuit to your favourable conſideration. Which if I might obtaine, I ſhould think vertue hath not quite forſaken the World, but that there lives ſuch ſparkes of goodneſſe in your breſt, as may be able to enflame poſterity with an emulation of your goodneſſe: I beſéech you therefore be not afraid to doe me a courteſie, becauſe I am a Stranger. For by how much you have leſſe inducements to ſhew me any favour, you ſhal\n•\n thereby make your vertue ſhine with more illuſtrious glory. I muſt confeſſe I have no great mans Letter to prdcure your liking and good opinion of mée, yet ſince my deſires are modeſt, and ſuch as you may grant with eaſe, I hope you will grant my requeſt, in requitall whereof I will proclaime your nobleneſſe and courteſie whereſoever I come, and will be ſure to mention you alwayes in my prayers, who have with the eyes of pitty lookt downe upon the neceſſities of a ſtranger But I will not urge you with any further importunity, but leave my ſuit to your conſideration. Verbum \n•\nat bono, few words prevaile with good men in a good cauſe.\n            \n\n               19. To aske a Fathers good will for marrying his Daughter.\n               SIr, it hath pleaſed your Daughter to beſtow her affection upon me, and now I muſt become a ſutor to you for your good will & liking: For ſo farre ſh\n•\n hath granted me her love, if it be ſeconded by your good allowance. I would intreat you therefore be pleaſed to ratify and eſtabliſh by your frée conſent what the Heavens have already decréed. For our hearts are already married in heaven, and we lacke nothing now but your conſent, which I hope I ſhall obtaine and ſince we have both béene obedient in making you acquainted with our deſires, I beſéech you ſéeke not to croſſe our loves, but give us both your bleſſing.\n\n\n               20. To begin a health.\n               GEntlemen, ſince we are now unable to commemorate our friends any other way than by remembring them in a health, I am bolo, out of the overflowing of my love, to dedicate this health to the memory of our abſent friends, I will fill it ſo full that a flye may drinke of it at the top, and will drinke it ſo clearely off, that a flye ſhall not be able to drink at the bottome. And thus Gentlemen I begin it, hoping that no man that honours his friend will refuſe it, for I would have the health in a circular orbe move round about the table, till every man hath had it: And ſo (as I ſaid before) I begin this health Ad ſalutem Amicorum. To the health of all our friends, wiſhing them as full a meaſure of all happineſſe, as this cup is full of Wine. I hope you'le pledge me Gentlemen.\n            \n\n               21. To promiſe to pledge it.\n               SIr, héeres no man will refuſe it, for my part I will continue the health for I am bound to ſecond it, ſince it is in memory to our friends, and therefore I will pledge it, though the glaſſe were ſo big, that the Moone might make a c\n•\n\nver to it.\n\n\n               22. To deſire to be excuſed.\n               GEntlemen, I muſt entreat your pardon, for I dare not drinke ſuch health, ſince I know I ſhould looſe mine owne health by it. Beſides, I hold it a heatheniſh cuſtome, and not becomming a Chriſtian. I ſhall therefore eſtéeme it a courteſy in you to diſpence with my pledging it; for to ſhew love to our friends by wronging our ſelves, were a part of folly rather then friendſhip. To which purpoſe I have written theſe verſes.\n               \nTis an \n•\nld rule now amonſt Bac\n•\nius traine,\nThat from our owne healthes drinking we refraine:\nYet now they doe begin healths to their friends,\nWhich with the loſſe of their owne health ſtill ends:\nAnd thus while of our friends, too much we make,\nWe love our friends but our owne ſelves we hate.\n\n\n\n               23. To acquaint one with a journey.\n               I Am to ride this morning toward London, and if you pleaſe to command mee any ſervice, I ſhall be carefull in the performance of it: or if you have any thing to buy, pray let me be your ſteward, Ile buy it as cheape as I can for it is a happineſſe to me to have any imploy, ment from you. If therefore you have any buſineſſe or cauſe to ſolicite, truſt me with it and I will uſe the beſt diligence I can to effectuate your deſires, or if you pleaſe to command me any other ſervice, you ſhall finde me your ready ſervant.\n\n\n               24. To thanke one for a courteſie.\n               SIr, I muſt acknowledge my ſelf indebted to you for your laſt courteſy, the remembrance makes me your debtor till I can finde ſome opportunity of requitall; neither will I bée ungratefull for your laſt favour, but will returne it with intereſt when Fortune ſhall enable me: in the mean time I would deſire you to reckon me in the number of thoſe that are beholding to you, and for your former crurteſies to take the payment of a friend, in a currant Engliſh shankes.\n            \n\n               25. To excuſe a friend in his abſence.\n               SIr, it is the part of one friend to excuſe another in his abſence, and therefore I intreate you not to be offended with him till you know the truth, but to interprete all things to the beſt. For I know it would much grieve him to gaine your diſpleaſure, and therefore let not your wiſedome cenſure him in his abſence for I know hée will cleare himſelfe at his returne. Bée pleaſed therefore to ſuſpend your anger a while, and let not your paſſion pronounce him guilty, before you know the truth: for if you will uniuſtly condemne him, I muſt riſe up in my friends defence, for howſoever his enemies have incenſed you againſt him, I dare engage my ſelfe hée is not guilty of thoſe calumnious ſlaunders which are heaped on him. Let me entreate you therefore not to give credit to the reports of malicious informers, who can with eaſe defame and caſt aſperſions upon the beſt men, but I would rather have you thinke the beſt of him, till you know the worſt, and then determine of as you find cauſe. If hée deſerve it. let him continue ſtill your friend if not, let him be wiped out of the number of your friends.\n            \n\n               26. The Wooers Complement.\n               SWéet Maide, the Sunne hath almoſt gone his yearely iourney about the World ſince firſt I beheld the Sunne of your beauty, which hath ſo dazled mine eyes, that I behold all other things as trifles in reſpect of thoſe glorious beames which do ſhoot themſelves from thence. If therefore c\n•\nntinuance of time may bée any aſſurance of fidelity in love, you muſt néedes confeſſe that I have long béene a devoted ſervant to your perfections. Bée pleaſed therefore now to accept that love of mine, which my fond heart cannot conceale, you are the darling of my thoughts, the treaſure of my heart, the \n•\nappineſſe of my life: neither would I live \n•\nndéed, but that I hope in time by my true ſer\n\n•\nice and obedience to obtaine your favour, Neither would I have you thinke that I ſlat\n\n•\ner you, for my tongue doth but interpret \n•\no my heart, and the heavens know with what a due reverence I honour you. If therefore my love be grounded upon vertuous deſires, you ought to cherriſh it, but if I ſeeke your wrong by ſatisfaction of my owne deſires, let me periſh in your favour, which is to me above all puniſhments. You are the Load-ſtone of my affection, your lips are the moyſt Adamants that doe attract me, one touch from your hand hath power to revive the dead faculties of age. There is muſick in your voyce, and a lovelines in all your actions. Blame me not then for loving you, but blame your ſelfe for being ſo worthy of love, and ſince your beauties haue wonnded me, let your gracious anſwer cure mée by conſenting to tie that holy knot of Marriage, which I have often urged. Make me happy in your anſwer.\n            \n\n               27. The Mayds anſwer.\n               SIr, as you are a friend to vertue, I cheriſh your Love and am perſwaded you love mée: but alas, wée Maydes have no power to give away our ſelves withou\n•\n conſent of Parents, neither can we diſpoſe o\n•\n our ſelves, or be liverall of our affections, til\n•\n our Parents be acqutinted with it. And therefore you muſt now become a Sutor to my Father; his liking obtain'd, mine ſhall follow, and if you get his good will: my hand ſhall give you my heart in the Church before the whole Congregation: in the meane time reſt aſſured, you ſhall find me conſtant in affection, and therefore you néede ſollicite mée no further, I am yours.\n            \n\n               28. The Wooers anſwer.\n               I Deſire no more happineſſe: for by your anſwere you have revived my drooping heart; neither would I change my eſtate with rich Croeſus, ſince I value the obtaining of your love above the Empire and Dominion of the whole world. I doubt not but we ſhall live and love together. And as for your Father, I hope he will grant us the priviledge due to al hearts, to love & to enioy: and I wil ſhortly take ſome fit opportunity to ſollicite his conſent: in the interim I muſt force my heart to take my leave of you, not daring to ſalute you for feare one kis ſhould tempt me back againe, but tis no matter, what we ſpare now, we will take out upon our Wedding day, Farewell.\n\n\n               29. To invite one home.\n               SIr, I have often deſired your company at home, but yet could never be ſo happy to obtaine it. But now you ſhall not deny to grace my poore houſe with your preſence, ſince we are hard by it, and to honou\n•\n me ſo much as to let the ſtar of your vertue ſhine within the ſphear of my houſe: for I dare promiſe though entertainement be not worthy your invitation, yet you ſhall be as welcome as a friend can be to a friend.\n\n\n               30. To excuſe with thankes.\n               SIr, I deſire your pardon, for my buſineſſe will not permit me, otherwiſe you ſhould not intreat me twice if I could grant it without much hinderance to my ſelfe. I am ſorry to refuſe your kind invitation, but I will promiſe to viſite you ſhortly, and ſince it is your deſire, I will be bold to call upon you. At this time I am enforced to withſtand my owne happineſſe by denying your frée invitation, but I hope you will excuſe me, and attribute it to my buſineſſe, not want of love.\n\n\n               31. To deliver a Letter to a Lady.\n               MAdam, héere's a Letter waites your peruſall; and deſires to be preſented to your Ladyſhips hand, the meſſenger told mée that it was ſent from your humbleſt ſervant Sir T. C.\n\n\n               32. The Ladies anſwer to her waiting-Gentlewoman.\n               VVHo bid you forſooth receive theſe amorous papers? I know tis lighter than a Complement and it may be 'twas written in a Taverne, I will not open it till I meane to laugh, for I meane to make it my recreation after meales. But I pray be carefull hereafter to receive no more, you know my mind, and now you cannot excuſe your ſelfe by ignorance\n\n\n               33. The Waiting-mayds anſwer.\n               I Shall obey your Ladyſhips command, for I will not gaine your Ladyſhips diſplea\n\n•\nure by receiving their Letters, though they \n•\nhould tempt me with a ſhower of Gold, I will not offend wilfully, but will ſtudy in all things to preſerve your favour: for it hath bée hitherto the aime of my deſires to continue my ſelfe in your Ladyſhips good liking, and I hope I ſhall never deſerve the contrary.\n            \n\n               34. The Servingmans wooing of Suſan a Chamber-Mayd.\n               SVſan, it is now thrée yeares ſince we have béene fellow-ſervants together. During which time I have received many courteſies from you, and béene invited to many a Sacke Poſſet, which kindneſſes of yours, though tending to no other end than to expreſſe your owne naturall good\n•\neſſe, have ſince invited me to love you. And now having both \n•\nate out the fi\n•\ne, and our candl\n•\n burning dimly, I thought this twi-light, would beſt become a Love-ſuit. For I profeſſe unto you Suſan, I love you with as much affection as my heart can obtaine: and albeit \n•\ne have often fallen out upon trifles, yet I did it but to try thy nature, which I found to be haſty (as the beſt natures are) but not able to retaine anger long, and therefore I hope you will forgive what is paſt, and conſider my motion which tends, to both our good. For is it not better to live fréely in the marryed ſtate of life, than to depend on ſervice, where every frowne is ready to caſt us off the hinges? for my part Suſan, though the unthriftines of my friends did firſt compell me to undertake a ſervile life, yet I could never bring my heart to affect it, and I know you are of the ſame mind, for I have heard you ſay, your Father was a wealthy Farmer, who comming behindhand with the world you were put forth to ſervice, which kind of life I know muſt néeds ſéeme tedious, and therefore I have propounded a way, whereby wée may both live a frée and happy life. I know you will obiect the want of meanes to mainetaine a charge or family. Tis true, but yet let us not deſpaire of Gods bleſſings, for have we not ſéene many Couples, whoſe whole ſtock could hardly purchaſe a Wedding Ring, and a Licence, who yet afterward by their owne endeavours have lived more contentedly than theſe great money-matches, which ſeldome proſper? for where there is love, there all things thrive, but where there is debate, there all things go to wrack. Love will ſupply the defects of want, ſo that if you pleaſe to entertaine my ſuite with your kind a\n•\ncep\n•\nance▪ you ſhall not only frée yo\n•\nr ſelfe from the ſubiection of a ſervant but live i\n•\n the ſſwéet yoke of marriage. And now Suſan I entreat you to cōſider theſe reaſons which I could enlarge but that I feare our Candle will goe out, and therefore having thus rudely with little art, but much affection, delivered my minde, I hope you will make me happy by your anſwer.\n            \n\n               35. Suſans anſwer.\n               \nROger, you are much miſtakē to interpret any curteſie of mine to procéed from love, though indéed I have alwaies loved you as one ſervant may love another. But for other matters (as they ſay) I never ſo much as dream't of them, and therefore doe not urge ſo vaine a ſuite, for I have ſomething elſe to doe, than to thinke of marriage. It is a ſigne Roger you live eaſily, for eaſe is the nurſe of love; but if you ſate up night by night, ſtarching as I doe, and then aroſe againe as early in the morning you would have little mind to entertaine a thought of love, And therefore hereafter buſie your ſelfe in ſome good imployment, & you ſhal ſée theſe idle fancies will vaniſh of themſelves. But if by this meanes your deſires be not abated, I will conſider better of your motion, and this is all I can ſay at this time, in anſwere of your ſuit. And ſo farewell, for I heare my Miſtris knocke above, and therefore I muſt be gone.\n            \n\n               36. To deſire a Mayd to ſpeake to the Miſtreſſe\n               SWéete-heart, I know your long and faithfull ſervice hath indear'd you into your Miſtreſſes opinion, ſo that ſhe rep\n•\nſes ſome truſt and confidence in your words, and I know you are not ignorant of thoſe ſtrange times & ſeaſons when womens fancies are moſt apt to receive Loves impreſſion If therefore you would pleaſe to take ſome houre of advantage to remember my ſuite to your Miſtreſſe, and would but caſt forth ſome words that may ſtir affection in my behalfe, I would not proove unthankfull, For though others have ſolicited you in the ſame way, yet if you will promi\n•\n mée your good word and aſſiſtance to preferre my ſute to your Miſtreſſe, I will requite it in your owne deſire, in earneſt whereof I would intreate you to weare this Ring; and to be mindfull of me in my abſence, that ſo at my next viſitatiō of your Miſtris, I may find her more i\n•\nc\n••\n\n\n•\nable to my ſu\n•\ne. Farewell.\n\n\n               37. To intreat lodging at a Gentlemans houſe.\n               SIr, being a ſtranger benighted and ſtrayed out of my may and finding that the Village Towne affords no Inne or houſe of receipt, I wouldgladly be beholding to you for this nights lodging till in the morning I may receive ſome better directions to procéed on my iourney.\n\n\n               38. The Gentlemans anſwer.\n               SIr, it is a courteſy that the lawes of hoſpitality bind me to performe. I muſt confeſſe our Towne is but ill provided for the entertainment of ſtrangers, and therefore if you pleaſe to accept of ſuch a meane lodging as my houſe can afford, you ſhall be welcome.\n\n\n               39. A bold Complement to a Widdow.\n               SWéet Widdow, I come not with a tedious Complement to win affection: but I come with love and youth, which are more gracefull qualities in a Widdowes eyes. I am indéed a younger brother, and have no land to indéere me into your liking, yet if you pleaſe (as they ſay) to caſt away yourſelfe upon a man, I hope I ſhal be able to delight you with the ſwéet contents of love. Thinke it not therefore the worſt charity to make a man, and to raiſe the fortunes of a yonger Brother, who only wants ſome of that white and red earth, which lyes by you ſo uncomfortably Come, I will not be put backe or daunted, nor will I take your no, for a denyall: for I know, however you Widdowes ſéeme to diſlike our boldneſſe▪ yet in your owne thoughts you doe commend us; when like good Souldiers comming up bravely, we make an aſſault upō your lips and ſcorne to retire, although your eyes ſhoot frownes againſt us. Thus far (ſwéet Widdow) I have bin bold with you, and I hope not more bold than welcome: yet leſt I ſhould p\n•\neſume too far, know therfore in plaine termes that albeit I am the laſt that hath ſollicited you for affection, yet doe I not leaſt affect you, but ſhould be glad of ſuch a comforter as yourſelfe, who by your good counſel may reclaim me from the wild unſtayed errors of my youth, for being once marryed, I wil faſt from all looſe affection, ſtriving night and day to make myſelf worthy of the title of your husband, which I hope you will grant me, that ſo our wooing may conclude in a wedding.\n            \n\n               40. The Widdowes anſwer.\n               ALas Sir, the remembrance of my late Husband, whoſe memory doth ever draw teares from mine eyes, his memory (I ſay) had ſo farre once prevailed, and was ſo déepely implanted in me, that I reſolved never to make a ſecond choyce. But yet I know not how, mooved rather out of pitty to your ſelfe, than any deſire of my owne, I am willing to ſecond your deſires in any lawfull affection. For I ſee you can ſpeake moovingly, and I muſt confeſſe you have wrought more upō me than many others whom I could put backe at any time by telling them with a ſerious countenance, that I never meant to marry. But I ſée you wil have no anſwer but in the right kind, and therefore (as I ſaid before) in pitty of your youth, hoping you will be a comfort to my age, and proove a good Husband, I am content to make you Maſter of my ſelfe and mine. But ſtill I ſay in pitty of your youth, for tis your youth and young blood that I love.\n\n\n               41. To wooe a Country Mayd\n               FAire Mayd the opportunity of occaſion, and the ſtrong bent of my affection (which will either break out in words, or breake my heart) compell me to take this ſhort time to diſcover my deſires unto you. The firſt time that I beheld you, was, when you were reaping your fathers corne, and then it ſéemed to mee that the golden eares did even bend unto your hands, & your ſtraw hat became you better than if you had wo\n•\ne a coronet of ſtarres. But indeed what néed you weare a ſtarry crown, whoſe eyes are ſtarres and have ſo powerfull an influence upon the beholders, that ever ſince that day, my heart hath never béen mine owne, but yours, and my thoughts have béene wholly given over to thinke of nothing but the obtaining your love, for which I am come now to entreate, b\n•\ngge, and ſue, knowing that you cannot be unmercifull: for if you will ſave your Fathers Lambs out of danger when they fall into a pit. if ſuch trifling things can moove your compaſſion. I hope you will a little commiſerate the dolou\n•\ns, and extreame paſſions of a Lover. For I per\n\n•\nwade you to nothing but that which is the end of your comming into this world▪ and that is marriage, for how ſoone would the world decay and come to nothing, if it were not preſerved by marriage? ſince therfore nature hath given you ſo large perfections, ſhe lookes that you ſhould requite her againe, and not to let your beauties wither on your chéeke, but to beſtow your youth and beauty on him who will honor you both in age and ſickeneſſe. For know this that beauty is a fading flower, which cannot long continue, and as Fryer Bacons headſpake, Time is, Time was, Time is paſt: ſo Mayds have their ſev\n•\nrall times and ſeaſons; for at 15. they are in their prime, and then Time is, at 30. Time was, and at 40. Time it paſt. But I néede not, I hope, uſe ſo many circumſtances in words, to come to the ſull point af Marriage, ſince you yourſelfe cannot be ignorant of my affection For when you went to milke, I have like a faint ſhadow followed you, ānd when you went to fold your fathers ſhéepe, I have helpt you all which were ſervices of that love and duty which my heart doth owe you. Be pleaſed therefore now out of the goodneſſe of your nature, and by that ſoft compaſſion which ſhould dwell in a Ma\n•\ndens heart▪ to grant me your love, and then I ſhal eſtéeme myſelfe more happy than the greateſt Monarch in the world. I beſéech you do not deny me, but let one chaſt kiſſe ſtrike a bargaine betwéene us, that ſo we may tie the true Lovers knot of marriage.\n            \n\n               42. The Country Maydes anſwer.\n               SIr, I had thought you would not have mockt me by laying beauty to my charge, for I have often beheld my face in the running ſtreame, but I wiſh I could never behold ſuch a dicker of beauty as you will aſcribe unto me. You compare my eyes unto ſtarres, and I know not what. Alas, Sir, doe you thinke we CountreyMayds are ſuch harmeleſſe innocent fooles that we are taken with fine fai\n•\ne words, which you Courtiers call Complements? Alas no, you may goe uſe them to Ladies: yet I know not how, mée thinkes your words come from you with ſuch fervency of affection, that I could find in my heart to anſwer you in your owne phraſe, for you muſt know wée Country Mayds can Complement as wel as you: know therefore that if your former words doe proceed out of chaſt deſire to marry mee, and if your heart hath beene ſo long a ſervant of mine I will not detaine your wages, but will pay you love for love againe, and that I know is the payment that you expect. But I pray boaſt not that you overcame me with a Complemēt though indéed I like your Complements very well, which being ſet forth with a languiſhing behaviour, did become you ſo wel, that I am content to yeeld my ſelfe to your diſpoſing, and to make my ſelfe an example to ſhew what great power a Complement delivered in due time and place may have over a mayds affection: and ſo without further ceremony, pray let our Ba\n••\nes be bidden, let the fidlers be hired to play upon our wedding day, and let the Mayds ſtrew the way to Church woth flowers, for your Complement hath overcome me, and ſo I leave you.\n            \nFINIS.\n", "image_url": "A58753/00006.000.001.right.png", "label": "0"}

Firſt the happie eſtait of the Kirk, from Chriſtis dayis to the dayis of the defectioun & of ye Antichriſt, in the firſt ſex verſis of this 20 chap. Nixt the defectioun it ſelf, in this place that I haue in hand, to wit, the ſeuint, aucht, nynt, and tent verſis. Thridlie the generall puniſhment of the wickit in ye greit day of Iudgement, from the tent vers to the end of the chaptour. The Apoſtles meaning in this place then is this, that efter that Sathan had bene bound ane thouſand ȝeiris, quhilk did appeir by his preceding diſcours of the ſaintis triumphing in the earth, he ſall at laſt brek furth agaue lows, and for ane ſpace rage in the earth mair then euer befoir: bot ȝit ſall in the end be ouercome and confoundit for euer. It reſtis now, knawing the ſumme, that we come to ye expoſitioun of thir verſis. And firſt we will expone or paraphraſe the hardnes of the wordis, nixt interpreit ye meaning of them, and thridlie note quhat we ſould learne of all.\n            \n\n               The firſt part.\n               AS to the wordis, in them for ordouris caus we man note, firſt Sathanis lowſing, nixt his doing efter that he is lowſit, and laſt his vnhappie ſucces. Then for ye firſt. Be Sathan is meanit nocht onlie the Dragone enemie to Chriſt and his Kirk, bot alſo with him all ye inſtrumentis in quhom he rewlis,Satan i\n•\n his inſtrumentis is lowſed to trouble the Kirk. and be quhom he vtteris his cruell and craftie intentioums, ſpecialie ye Antichriſt and his clergie: ioynit with ye Dragone befoir in the ſextene chap. verſ. 17. and callit the beaſt and ye falſe prophete. For as Chriſt and his Kirk ar callit efter ane name Chriſt, be reſſoun of thair maiſt aret vnioun, and heuinlie effectis flowing thairfra. 1, Cor. 12.12. ſa Sathan and his ſynagoge ar heir richtlie callit Sathan be reſſoun of thair vnioun and curſit effectis flowing thairfra. Thir thouſand ȝeiris ar bot ane numbercertane for ane vncertane, quhilk phraſe is oft vſit be the Spirit of God in the ſcriptures, meaning ane greit number of ȝeiris. Mair ouer the preſone quhairout of he is lowſit is ye hellis quhilk by ye Spirit of God ar callit his preſone for twa cauſes. Ane becaus during the tyme of this warld at tymes appointit be God he is debarrit from walking in the earth and ſend thair, greatlie to his torment,2. Pet. 2.\n•\n. Iude verſe \n•\n. as was teſtifeit be ye miracle at Geneſareth amangis the Gadarenis. Math. 8.28. Nixt becaus efter ye conſummatioun of ye warld he ſall be perpetuallie impreſonit thairin as is writtin mye ſame chap. verſ. 10. Finalie he is lowſit be interruptioun, and for ye maiſt part, to ye iudgement of men, abolitioun of the ſynceir preaching of ye Goſpell, ye trew vſe of ye Sacramentis quhilkis ar ye ſealis & pledgis of ye promiſis contenit thairin, and lawfull exerciſe of chriſtiane diſcipline, quhairby baith word and ſacramentis ar mantenit in puritie, callit in ye firſt vers, The greit chaine quhairby ye Dragone is bound, and ſignifeit be ye quhyte horſe gouernit be ye Lamb. chap. 6. ver. 2. Swa ye meaning of all yis 7 vers is this: The deuill, hauing bene bound, & his power in his inſtrumentis hauing bene reſtrainit for a lang ſpace be ye preaching of ye goſpell, at laſt he is lowſed out of hell by ye raiſing vp of ſamony new errouris and notable euill inſtrumentis, eſpecialie ye Antichriſt and his clergie, quha not onlie infectit ye earth of new, bot impyrit alſo ouer ye haill, through the decreſſe of trew doctrine and ye number of ye faithfull following it, and ye daylie incres of errouris, and natiounis following them, beleuing lies, haiting ye treuth, and taking pleaſour in vnrichteouſnes. 2. Theſſ. 2.11.12. And this far for Sathanis lowſing. Now to the nixt, his doing efter that he is lowſit. Firſt he gois ont to ſeduce ye natiounis that a\n•\n into ye four corneris of ye earth,Satan firſt deceiuis, then allures to follow him, and in end makis all his to tak armour againſt the Kirk. and they become his, thocht in certaine degreis his tirannie and trauell appearis, and birſtis out in ſome mair then in vtheris. For as all that do guid ar inſpyrit be God thairto, and vtteris the ſame in certane degreis, according to the meaſour of grace grantit vnto them. Sa all that do euill ar inſpyred be Sathan, and vtteris the ſame in diuerſe degreis, according asthat ducleue ſpirit takis poſſeſſioun in them, and be diuerſe obiectis alluris them to do his will, ſum be ambitioun, ſum be inuie, ſum be malice, and ſum be feir, and ſo furth, and this is his firſt wark. Secundlie he gatheris Gog and Magog to battell in number lyke the ſand of the ſea, and ſo he and his inclynit to battell and bludeſhed, haue michtie armies, and in number mony, inflammed with crueltie. The ſpeciall heidis and rewlaris of thir armies, or rather rankis of confederatis to go to battell and to fecht ar twa heir named, Gog and Magog. Gog in Hebrew is callit hid and Magog reueled, to ſignifie that in twa ſortis of men cheiflie Sathan ſall vtter him ſelf, to wit, hypocritis and awowit enemers to God. It is ſaid then that Sathan ſall in the letter tymes impyre of new ouer the Warld, quho ſall ſteir vp the nationis vnder the baneris of thir twa enemeis to God, the hypocriticall and awowit, to ſprid them ſelfis in greit multitudes vpon the earth. Thridlie they ſall aſcend vpon the plane of the earth, preſumpteouſlie and proudlie bragging of thair number and force, and thinking nane ſall be abill to reſiſt thair rage. They ſall compaſſe and beſiege the campis of the ſaintis, and the belouit eitie, that is, the handfull of the faithfull belouit of the Lord, quhome agams, confyding in thair vntellable number lyke the ſand of the ſea, they ſall mak a cruell and vnceaſſabill weir. The elect ar callit ſaintis and belouit.The ele\n••\n at the Sain\n•\nes, and the beloued citie of GOD. becaus they ar in the lufe of God ſelectit, and be grace ingrauit in Chriſt, in quhome they ar comptit and fund iuſtifeit, ſanctifeit, worthie of loue and endles glorie. Thair faithfull fellowſhip is comparit to tentis, and to a citie belouit, to ſignifie thair continuall weirfair in the earth aganis Sathan and ſinne, with all his inſtrumentis: thair mutuall amitie and freindlie coniunctioun in loue amangis them ſelfis: and concurrence to mancene the guid caus that thair God hes cled them with: bot cheiflie to ſignifie the michtie and all ſufficient protectioun in proſperitie and aduerſitie, flowing from God for thair iuſt defence aganis all powers that can perſew, quhairby they alſo become fair as the Mone, pure as the Sone, terrible as ane armie with baueris, Cant. 1.6, 9. ȝea as a defencit citie: ane irne pillair: andwallis of bras againſt ye haill earth. Ier. 1.18. The ſ\n•\nmne then of Sathanis doingis efter he is lowſit is this: He ſall deceiue ye natiounis: he ſall gather ane infinit number of hypocritis and awowit enemeis togidder inflammed with crueltie, and thir ſall in prydefull preſumptioun fearcelie bend them felfis againſt ye choſm of God, and his treuth profeſſit be them. Bot quhat at laſt ſall ye ſucces be? Suirlie maiſt vnhappy. For fyre ſall cum doun from heauin, and deuour them, and ye deuill yat deceauit them and all his inſtrumentis, cheiflie ye beaſt and fals prophet ſall be caſt in ane laik of fyre and brintſtone, and ſall be tormented day and nycht inceſſantlie for euer and euer: that is, how greit that euer thair braggis be, how neir yat euer they ſall appeir to be at thair intent, God from heuin as the palace and throne quhairfra he geuis pruife of his mercie towardis his awin, and of his iuſtice towardis his enemeis, ſall ſend plagues and deſtructioun, aſweiſt ordinar, as extraordinar, vpon them. Ordinar be reueiling thair wickitnes be ye thundering mouthes of trew paſtouris, quhilk is oft callit fyre in the ſcriptures. Extraordinar by all corporall plagues to thair vtter deſtructioun and vntellable torment for euer in the hellis. This far for the expolitioun or paraphraſe of the wordes.\n            \n\n               The ſecund part.\n               NOW followis the interpretatioun of the ſentence according to the ordour vſit in the firſt part. And firſt we man knaw quhat time thir thouſand or mony ȝeiris was in, and quhen and how was Sathan lowſit.The puritie of the Goſpell in during ſt\n•\nyes the Ant\n••\nh\n•\niſti\n•\n ry\n•\ni\n••\ng. This time is to be found in the ſaxt chaptour, in the opening of the firſt thrie ſeales of ye ſecreit buik of Gods prouidence beye Lamb: To wit, ye time quhen the quhyte, read, and black horſes had their courſe in the warld. And to ſpeak mair plainely, ye Deuils power did lurk, quhilk is callit his binding, and ye Euangell did floreiſh in ane reſſonable puritie mony hundreth ȝeiris efter Chriſt, as ye Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories beir witnes. For in greit puritie the Goſpell did continue lang, quhilk is ſignifeit by the courſe of the quhyt hors, albeit ye profeſſouriswee vnder ye croce ſignifyit by ye reid hors, and traublit wonderfullie be heretickis, ſignifeit by ye blak hors, by wormewod that fell in ye fontainis of wateris in ye thrid trumpet, and by wateris that ye Oragone ſpewit out of his mouth in ye viſioun of ye Dragone and ye woman. chap. 12. This tyme did indure from Chriſt, ane ſpace efter Auguſtinis duy is, quhen ye bloodie ſword of perſecutioun ceaſſing, ye haill Kirk began to be defylit with diuerſe hereſies, quhilk cumming to ane mature & rype heip did produce ye Antichriſt, ſignifeit be ye paill hors in ye fourt ſeall,\n\n••\no Goſpel \n〈…〉\n be \n〈…〉\n. by ye king of ye locuſtis in ye 5 trumpet, by Babylon in ye 11 & 18 chap. by ye ſecund beaſt ryſing out of ye ſea in ye 13 chap. and by ye woman cled with ſcarlet in ye 17. The aryſing of ye hereſeis and ye Antichriſt breading of thair ſmok is in this place callit ye lowſing of Sathan. Now followis efter this his lowſing quhat he dois: He deceiuis ye natiounis vniuerſallie: he gatheris Gog and Magog with intellable armies to fecht: he leuies vp vpon ye plane of ye earth: he compaſſis ye tentis of ye ſaintis, and ye belouit citie about. Thir ar his doingis. Now becaus thir actiounis ar maiſt viuelie declarit in vther placis of ye ſame buik, I will ſhortlie alleage them to mak ye mater cleir be conference of places expomng euery ane ane vther. It is ſaid in ye 9 chap. that ye Antichriſt ſall hound out his locuſtis or eccleſiaſtick ordouris be fair allurementis to intyſe ye warld to ȝeild to his & thair abominable hereſeis, and ſall preuaill ouer ye maiſt part. It is ſaid in ye 11 chap. that he ſall perſecute ye ſaintis, kill ye twa witneſſis, and ſall reioyce with ye kingis of ye earth for thair killing, as hauing bene ye onlie lettis to his full glorie. It is ſaid in ye 13 chap. that he ſall blaſpheme God in vſurping his power: that be ye aduiſe and aſſiſtance of ye fals prophet or fals kirk he ſall ſend out his imagis or ambaſſadouris throw ye warld perſecuting and deſtroying them that will nocht obey him and them, and acknawledge his ſupremacie: ȝea nane ſall be ſufferit to by or ſell or vſe ciuill ſocietie that acknawledgis not his ſupreme power and dignitie. It is ſaid in ye 16 chap. that God plaguing him for thir forſaidis abuſis, he ſall be ſa far from repentance, as be ye coutrair he ſall find out anenew ſort of vermine, that is, are new eccleſiaſtick ordour, quhilk at callit thair froggis, quha ſall moue and entyſe ye princes of the earth to ioyne with him and mak weir againſt ye faithfull, preiſſing vtterlie to deſtroy them: and of that battell and the end thairof dois this place mak mentioun. Now ſhortlie ioyne all this togidder, and ſa obtene the meaning. Thair ſall aryſe ane Antichriſt and enemie to God & his Kirk: he ſall be hew of ane fals and hypocriticall Kirk: he ſall clame ane ſupreme power in earth: he ſall vſurpe the power of God: he ſall deceiue men with abuſing locuſtis: he ſall perſecute ye faithfull: nane ſall be fund that dar awowedlie reſiſt him: in end, feiling his kingdome decay, and the trew kirk beginning to kyith, he ſall by ane new ſort of deceiuing ſpiritis gather togidder the kingis of the earth in greit multitudis lyke the ſandis of the ſea, and by concurrence, or at leiſt the tollerance of that vther greit awowit enemie he ſall with thir numbers compaſſe the oampis of the faithfull, beſeage the belouit citie, mak weir againſt the ſaintis: bot victorie ſall he not haue,The Pape \n〈◊〉\n Antichriſt, & Paperie ye lowſing of Satan, ſ\n••\n quhom proceidis f\n•…\n doctrine, and crueltie to ſubuert ye kingdome of Chriſt. and ſhame and confuſioun ſall be his and all his partakeris end. Now quhither the Pape beiris thir markis or not, let ony indifferent man iudge: I think ſurelie it exponis the ſelf: Dois he not vſurpe Chriſtis office calling him ſelf vniuerſall biſhop, & heid of the kirk: Playis he not ye part of Apollyon and Abaddon the king of the locuſtis and deſtroyer or ſone of perditioun, in chopping and changing ſaulis betuixt hewin, hell, & fantaſtick purgatorie at his pleaſour: Blaſphemis he not in denying vs to be ſaiff by ye imputatioun of Chriſtis iuſtice. Mairouer hes he not ſend furth and abuſie ye warld with innumerable ordouris of locuſtis and ſhaue lingis. Hes he not ſa fullie impyrit ouer ye warld thir mony hundreth ȝeiris as to ye fyre ȝeid he, quhat ſumeuer he was, yat durſt deny ony part of his vſurpit ſupremacie: And hes he not of lait dayis ſeing his kingdome going to decay, ſend out the Ieſuitis, his laſt and maiſt pernicious vermine, to ſteir vp the Princes of the earth his ſlauis, to gather and league them ſelfis togidder for his defence, and rooting out of all them that profeſſ\n•\ns Chriſt trewlie. And quhairas ye awowed enemie of God ye Turke was vnder bloodie weiris with him euer befoir, is their not of ſait anetrewis amaugis them, that the faithfull may be mair eaſilie rooted out. And ar nocht preſentlie ye armies amaſſit, ȝea vpon ye verie point of thair executioun: In France againſt the ſaintis thair: In Flanders for the lyke: and in Germanie, be quhom alreddie ye Biſchop of Colley ne is diſplacit: And quhat is preparit and cum fordwart againſt this Ile: Do we not daylie heir: and be all appearance ſhortlie ſall ſee: Now may ȝe iudge gif this be not ye tyme quhairof this place that I haue maid chois of doeth meane, and ſa ye dew tyme for the reueiling of this prophecie. This far for ye interpretatioun of the ſentence.\n            \n\n               The thrid part.\n               NOW I cum to the laſt part, quhat we may learne of this place, quhilk I will ſhortlie tuiche in few pointis and ſa mak end. And firſt of ye deuillis lowſing be ye ryſing of ye Antichriſt, for ye iuſt puniſhment of ye vnthankfull warld haiting ye treuth and delyting in lies, and manifeſting of his awin choſin that ſtak to ye treuth: we haue twa thingis to note.Mannis ſinne p\n•••…\n Gods iuſtice to lows Satan. Ane for inſtructioun, that ye iuſtice of God in reſpect of mannis falling wilfullie from ye treuth (as Paull ſayis) iuſtlie did ſend to ye warld the greit abuſer with efficacie of lies, aſweill to tyrannize ſpirituallie ouer ye conſcience be hereſie, as corporallie ouer thair bodyis be ye ciuill ſworde. And thairfoir we man feir to fall from ye treuth reuiled, and profeſſed be vs, that we may be frie from ye lyke puniſhment. The vther for our comfort,Apoſtates ſall p\n•\nr\n••\nlie, conſtant chriſtianes ſall be crouned. that yis tyrannie of ye Antichriſt ſifting out ye caffe from ye corne, as our Maiſter ſayis, ſall tend to ye double condemnatioun of ye falleris bak, and to ye double croun of glorie to ye perſeueireris. Bliſſit thairfoir ar they that perſeueir to ye end,Math. 10.\n••\n\n for they ſall be ſaiff.\n\nThe defectioun vnder ye Antichriſt ſall be vniuerſall.Nixt of ye number of natiounis in the four quarteris of ye earth deceaued, and companies gatherit togidder to fecht lyke the ſand of ye ſea: we ar teachit that ye defectioun vnder ye Antichriſt was generall, and ſa na viſible Kirk was thair: Quhairof twa thingis followis. Ane, the Kirk may be corruptit and erre: Ane vther, the Kirk may lurk and be vnknawinfor ane certane ſpace.\n               Thridlie of that that Sathan is not coutentit onlie to deceaue, except he alſo gather to ye battell his inſtrumentis:Satans children baith deceiue and perſe\n••\n. we ar informit of ye implacable malice borne be Sathan in his inſtrumentis againſt God in his members, quha neuer reaſſis lyke ane roring lyoun (as Peter ſayis) to go about aſſailleing to deuour. This his malice is notablie deſcriuit in ye 12 and 13 chap. of this buik: for it is ſaid that quhen he had ſpewed out greit riueris of wateris, yat is, infinit hereſies and lies to ſwallow vp ye woman, and notwithſtanding ſho was delyuerit thairfra: ȝit agane he raiſit vp ane beaſt out of ye ſea, ye bloodie Romane impyre be ye ſworde, to deuour hir and hir ſeid: and that being woundit deidlie, ȝit he raiſis ane vther beaſt furth of ye earth, quhilk is ye Antichriſt, be hereſie and ſworde toynit togidder to do his turnis. Saye Deuill ſeing that na miſt of hereſies can obſcure ye euangell in ye hartis of ye faithfull, nather ye cruell ſworde of perſecuteris can ſtay ye proſperous ſucces of Chriſtis kingdome he raiſis vp ye Antichriſt with baith his ſwordis, to the effect that, as ane of them ſayis, that quhilk Peters keyis culd nocht, Pauls ſword ſould. And ſo hes he done at this tyme: For ſen ye trew Kirk will not be abuſit with ye abſurde hereſies, for laſt refuge, now rooted out moſt they be by ye ciuill ſword.\nFerdlie of thair greit numberis abill to compaſſe about ye tentis of ye ſaintis, and to beſeage ye halie cities:The wickit i\n•\n numbers euer ouerpaſſe ye godlie. we ar informed that ye wickit ar euer ye greiteſt part of ye warld. And thair foir our Maiſter ſayis, Many ar callit, few choſin: and agane, Vyde is ye way that leidis to deſtructioun, and many enter thairat: Bot narrow is ye way that leidis to lyfe, and few enter thairat. Alſo he callis them ye warld, and the Deuill the Prince of ye ſame,\nFyftlie ye agreance of Gog and Magog, the Turke ye awowit enemie, and ye Pape ye couered enemie,The wickit at variance amangis thē ſelf, can we ll agrie in an\n•\n againſt Chriſt. to this perſecutioun: declaris ye rooted haitred of ye wickit againſt ye faithfull: quha thocht they be vtherwayis in enimitie amangis them ſelfis, ȝit greis in that reſpect, in odium tertij, as did Herode and Pilate.\nSextlie the compaſſing of ye ſaintis, and beſeaging of ye belouit citie,The fals Kirk ouer perſe\n\n••\ntes. declaris to vs ane certane note af ane fals Kirk to be perſecutioun.

The vther note is, that efter ye greit perſecutioun and deſtructioun of ye perſeweris ſall ye day of iudgement follow. For ſa declaris ye 11 vers of ye ſame chaptour. Bot in how ſhort ſpace it fall follow, that is onlie knawin vnto God. Onlie this far ar we certane, that in that laſt eſtait without ony ma generall mutatiounis ye warld ſall remane till ye conſummatioun.\nTo conclude then with exhortatioun: It is all our dewties in this Ile at yis tyme to do twa thingis.All men ſuld be lawfullie ina\n•\nmed ſpiritualite and bodelie to ſeekt againſt ye Antichriſt and his ſu\n•\n\n\n\n•\noſtes.

They ſuppoſe, that if a Man ſhould raze the Names out of a Petition to their Majeſties, and put the French King's Name in their place, that it would no longer be a Petition to them, but to their mortal Enemy; and therefore in Reply to the next Queſtion which follows about the ſame Liturgie, they ſay, this change of Names has changed the Prayers in the Liturgie, and that this change diſguſts their Conſciences, and helps to drive them from your Churches, being one cauſe of their Separation from the Publick, and but one; for as I juſt now ſhewed your Grace, there was another, of which you were pleaſed to take no notice.\n            Ay, but you ſay, they proceed ſo far as to declare open War, and ſet up ſeparate Congregations in oppoſition to the publick. To this they ſay, for the foreſaid Reaſons, That they did not begin this ſpiritual War, which on their ſide is purely Defenſive, becauſe they are driven from the Publick, and that the ſame Reaſons that will juſtifie their Separation from it, will alſo juſtifie ſetting up ſeparate Meetings in oppoſition to it, in which they think the pure Church of England, with her pure Worſhip, may be ſeen and heard like the Church of Jeruſalem, in the firſt perſecution of Chriſtianity, in the upper rooms.

You will not deny but the Multitude or Publick are now the Schiſmaticks in Scotland; they were ſo under the Donatiſt Biſhops in Africk; they were ſo in England under the Popiſh Marian Biſhops; they were ſo under Aaron in the buſineſs of the Calf; they were ſo in Iſrael under Ahab and the Idolatrous Prieſts; and, laſtly, they were ſo under the Arian Emperours and Biſhops, throughout the whole Roman Empire.

The ſinne of luxury is very pleaſing to the diuell,Their booke of the remedie againſt the ſinne of luxury. Chap 21. diſpleaſing vnto God, and iniurious againſt our neighbours, becauſe therein a man obeyeth the baſeſt part of his bodie, rather then God who hath preſerued it. A fooliſh woman doth not onely take from a man his good, but himſelfe too. He that is giuen to this vice keepes faith to no man, and therefore Dauid cauſed his faithfull ſeruant to be ſlaine, that he might enioy his wife. Amon defiled his ſiſter Tamar. This vice cōſumes the heritage of many, as it is ſaid of the prodigall child, that he waſted his goods liuing luxuriouſly. Balaam made choiſe of this ſinne, to prouoke the children of Iſrael to ſinne, by occaſion whereof there died twenty foure thouſand perſons. This ſinne was the cauſe of the blindneſſe of Sampſon: it peruerted Salomon: and many haue periſhed by the beautie of a woman. Prayer, and faſting, and diſtance of place are the remedies againſt this ſinne. For a man may ouercome other vices by combating with them, but in this a man is neuer victorious but by flying from it, and not approching neare vnto it: whereof we haue an example in Ioſeph. It is therefore our duties to pray daily to the Lord, that he will keepe vs farre from the ſinne of luxury, and giue vs vnderſtanding and chaſtitie.\n\nSee their book of Vertues, in the Chapter of marriage.Againſt the ſecond impoſture, that they maintaine that a man may put away his wife when it pleaſeth him, they ſay that marriage is a knot that cannot be vntyed but by death, except it be for fornication, as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith. And Saint Paul 1. Corinth. 7. ſaith, That the wife is not to depart from her husband, nor the husband from his wife.\n                     \nSee the booke of the Waldenſes intituled of vertues in the Chapter of mariage.To the third calumnie, touching the communitie of goods and wiues, they ſay concerning marriage, that it was ordained by God long ſince in the terreſtriall Paradiſe, and that it is a good remedie againſt whoredome. And that Saint Paul ſpeaking thereof ſaith, Let euery man haue his wife, and euery woman her husband: As alſo that the husband ought to loue his wife as Chriſt loued his Church, and that the married couple ought to liue together in holineſſe with their children, bringing them vp in the feare of God.\nAs touching goods, euery man hath poſſeſſed his owne proper ſubſtance at all times and in all places. In Dauphiney,\n\nIt appeareth by the proces that we haue in our hands, by which it appeares that Lewes the 12. of that name, condemned the vſurpers of the goods of the Waldenſes to a reſtitution.\nIt appeares by the treatiſes of Meneobe, and other inſtances made by the Waldenſes of Prouence.\n when the Archbiſhops of Ambrun, Iohn and Roſtain, had ſpoiled them of their goods: when the Lord of Argentiere, and Montainar, and Arreas of Bonne had diſpoſſeſſed the Waldenſes that dwelt in the valley of Fraiſſimere and of Argentiere of their goods and poſſeſſions, the reſtitution of euery mans inheritance was proſecuted by the particular perſons from whom they had taken them. The Waldenſes of Prouence do demand at this preſent of the Pope, the goods and lands which haue bene annexed to their demaine, and taken from them by confiſcation, euery particular perſon making faith for euery part and parcell of goods and lands which had deſcended vpon them from their anceſtors the Waldenſes time out of mind, they neuer hauing had any ſuch\ncommunitie amongſt them, that might any way derogate from that lawfull proprietie which euery one had to his owne lands.\n                     The fourth calumnie was touching Baptiſme, which,In the booke of the Waldenſes intituled the Spiritual Almanacke. fol. 45. it is ſaid, they denied to little infants: but from this imputation they quit themſelues as followeth.\nThe time and place of thoſe that are to be baptized is not ordained, but the charitie and edification of the Church and congregation muſt ſerue for a rule therein, &c.\nAnd therefore they to whom the children were neareſt allied brought their infants to be baptized, as their parents, or any other whom God had made charitable in that kind.\nTrue it is, that being conſtrained for ſome certaine hundred yeares to ſuffer their children to be baptized by the Prieſts of the Church of Rome, they deferred the doing thereof as long as they could poſſibly, becauſe they had in deteſtation thoſe humane inuentions which were added to that holy Sacrament, which they held to be but pollutions therof. And foraſmuch as their Paſtors (which they called Barbes) were many times abroad imployed in the ſeruice of their Churches, they could not haue the Sacrament of Baptiſme adminiſtred to their infants by their owne Miniſters: for this cauſe they kept them long from Baptiſme, which the Prieſts perceiuing, and taking notice of, charged them thereupon with this impoſture: which not onely their aduerſaries haue beleeued, but diuerſe others who haue well approued of their life and faith in all other points.\nThe fifth calumnie was, that they adored their Paſtors, proſtrating themſelues before them. To iuſtifie the Waldenſes from this impoſture, there needs no more, but that\nthe Reader will be pleaſed to take the paines to reade that which they haue written touching the adoration of one onely God, in the expoſition that they made in the booke of their doctrine vpon the firſt Commandement of the Law of God. There you ſhall find that they haue giuen much honour euen to their Paſtors, as vnto thoſe that keepe the word of Reconciliation, entertaining them charitably, accompting themſelues obliged thereunto for conſcience ſake; but that they euer had any intention to giue that worſhip to the creature that is onely due vnto the Creator, can neuer be made good but by way of calumnie.It appeareth by the proceſſe formed by the ſaid Albert againſt the Waldenſes of the Alpes. Howſoeuer Albert de Capitaneis their deadly enemie in the Dioceſſe of Turin, would haue extorted from them, that they adored their Paſtors, which he could neuer enforce them to confeſſe.\n                     The ſixt calumnie was, that they maintained, that it was not lawfull to ſweare at all.\n\nIn their booke intituled the Spirituall Almanacke, in the expoſition of the third commandement.They ſay and affirme, that there are lawfull oathes tending to the honour of God and the edification of our neighbours, alledging that place in the 6. Heb. 16. That men ſweare by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all ſtrife. As alſo they alledge, that it was enioyned the people of Iſrael to ſweare by the name of the eternall God, Deut. 6.13. and the examples of thoſe oathes that paſt betweene Abimelec and Iſaac, Gen. 26.31. and the oath of Iacob, Gen. 31.53.\nThe ſeuenth calumnie was, to make them odious to the people, as if they had preferred the peace with the Turke, before that with the Church & the kingdome of Chriſt, affirming that they maintained, that the Pope did mortally ſinne when he ſends an expedition of ſouldiers with the badge of the croſſe vpon their Caſſockes or Coatarmour againſt the Sarazens.\n\nFor their iuſtification herein, we muſt obſerue,In the booke of the cauſes of their ſeparation frō the Church of Rome. p. 235 that they complaine not of the enterpriſe of warre againſt the Turkes, but of thoſe ſpoiles that the Popes make of the goods of the Church and other diuine graces vnder the pretence thereof, abuſing the ignorant people with their Buls and Benedictions, who too willingly receiue their lies and inuentions, buying them at a deare rate. As alſo they thinke hardly of it, that the Pope ſhould ſend out his Croiſades, his croſſed ſouldiers being ſtrangers, to purſue them as heretickes, before they be heard or conuinced to be ſuch.\n                     But they are not the onely men that condemne this auarice, which the reuenging ſpirits of the Popes haue ſhewed by their Croiſades.\n\n\nPaulus Langius a Germane Hiſtoriographer layes an imputation vpon Leo the tenth,\nPaul. Lan. in his Chronicle of France 1513. See the examination of the Councell of Trent. lib. 1. c. 5, that he leuied great ſummes of money vnder a pretence of warre againſt the Turkes, which he beſtowed ſhortly after vpon thirtie Cardinals, which he had newly created.\n\nGuicciardine noteth in his Hiſtorie, that the ſelfe ſame Pope impoſed great exactions vpon the people, the benefit whereof fell into the lap of his ſiſter Magdalen, and that all that leuie of money was but to ſatisfie the auarice of a woman, and that the Biſhop of Aremboldo was thought by him a commiſſarie worthy ſuch an action, to put it in execution with all manner of extortion.\n\nAlexander the fourth conuerted the vow of Hieruſalem, to the vow of Pouille, that is to ſay,A part of Naples, whoſe inhabitants are held very dangerous. the vow of reuenge: For he gaue power to his Legats to abſolue the King of England, Henry the third by name, diſpenſing with his vow of the croſſe for Hieruſalem, vpon condition that he ſhould go to Pouille, to make warre againſt Manfred Frederic Emperour not long before. It is the Hiſtoriographer\nMath. Paris,\n\n\nMath. Paris in his Hiſtorie of England.\nSee the firſt booke of the examination of the Councell of Trent. cap. 5. In the booke of the cauſes of their ſeparation frō the Church of Rome. p. 125\n that ſetteth downe the complaint that then was made, that is to ſay, that the tenths imployed for the ſuccour of the holy Land, were taken away and conuerted to the reliefe of Pouille, againſt the Chriſtians.\n                     The eight calumnie was, that they vſed no reuerence towards holy and conſecrated places, holding that that man ſinned not more grieuouſly that burneth a Church, then he that breakes into any other houſe.\nThey ſay, that neither the place, nor the chaire, make a man the more holy, and they haue maintained that they deceiue themſelues much that comfort themſelues, or preſume the more, becauſe of the dignitie of the place: for what place more high then Paradiſe? what place more ſecure then heauen? and yet neuertheleſſe man was baniſhed out of Paradiſe for ſinning there; and the Angels were throwne from heauen, to the end they might be examples to thoſe that came after, and to teach them, that it is not the place, nor the greatneſſe nor dignitie thereof, that makes a man holy, but the innocencie of his life.\nAgainſt the ninth calumnie, that is to ſay, that they defend that the Magiſtrate ought not to condemne any to death, they ſay:\n\nIn the booke of the Waldenſes entituled The light of the treaſure of faith. fol. 214.That it is writtē, that we are not to ſuffer the malefactor to liue, and that without correction and diſcipline doctrine ſerues to no purpoſe, neither ſhould iudgements be acknowledged nor ſinnes puniſhed. And therefore iuſt anger is the mother of diſcipline, and patience without reaſon, the ſeed of vices, and permitteth the wicked to digreſſe from truth and honeſtie.\n\nIt appeareth by the complaint they made to the King Ladiſlaus, King of Hungary and Bohemia.True it is that they haue found fault that the Magiſtrates ſhould deliuer them to death, without any other\nknowledge of the cauſe, then the ſimple report of Prieſts and Monkes, who were parties and iudges, inſomuch that hauing diſcouered the abuſe which they brought into the Church, they condemned them for heretickes, and deliuered them to the ſecular power (ſo they call their Magiſtrates.) Now this ſeemed vnto them a cruell ſimplicitie in the ſaid Magiſtrates, to giue faith to perſons paſſionate and not indifferent, ſuch as the aforeſaid Prieſts were, and to put to death ſo many poore innocent people, neuer hearing them or examining the cauſe.\n                     The tenth calumnie, was to make them odious to Kings and Princes, that is to ſay, that a lay man in the ſtate of grace, had greater authoritie then a Prince liuing in his ſinnes.\nAgainſt this impoſture they affirme,In the booke of the cauſes of their ſeparation frō the Church of Rome. p. 41. that euery one muſt be ſubiect to thoſe that are in authoritie, obey them, loue them, be at peace with them, honour them with double honour, in ſubiection, and obedience, and readineſſe, paying vnto them that which is their due.\nThe eleuenth calumnie was grounded vpon that aſſertion of the Waldenſes, that the Pope had no authoritie ouer the Kings and Princes of the earth, who depend immediatly vpon God alone. For from thence they take occaſion to call them Manichees, as appointing two Princes.\nAgainſt this imputation they ſay;In the booke of the treaſure of faith. art. 2. We beleeue that the holy Trinitie hath created all things viſible and inuiſible, and that he is Lord of things celeſtiall, terreſtiall, and infernall, as it is ſaid in S. Iohn, All things are made by him, and without him nothing is made.\n\nThe beginning of this calumnie was taken out of the Extrauagantes of Pope Boniface 8. who ſubiecting the authoritie\nof Emperours vnto his, ſaith of his owne, Quicunque huic potestati reſiſtit, Dei ordinationi reſiſtit, niſi duo (ſicut Manichaeus) fingat eſſe principia. De Maiorit. & obedientia, Can. Vnam ſanctam. l. 1. tom. 8.\n                     The twelfth calumnie imports thus much, that they held that whatſoeuer is done with a good intention is good, and that euery one ſhall be ſaued in whatſoeuer is done with the ſaid good intention.\nTo this impoſture we need no other anſwer then that which the Monke Raynerius (who was alwaies their back-friend) ſaith elſewhere,Rain. lib. de forma haeretic, art. 38.\n that is, that they maintaine that euery man is ſaued by his faith, which he cals a Sect. It is very neceſſary that a lyer ſhould haue a better memorie, then to affirme things contradictorie.\nAnd to ſhew that they made no profeſſion of any ſuch beleefe, that may ſuffice that they haue ſaid againſt Antichriſt; That he hath brought theſe errors into the Church vnder a colour of good intention, and a ſhew of faith.\nThe thirteenth calumnie was, that they maintaine that a man may kill, or detaine from the Prieſts their tithes, without ſcruple of conſcience.\nIt is certaine that if the Waldenſes had power to employ their tithes to ſome other vſe then to the nouriſhment of thoſe whom they find to be dumbe dogs, drowſie watchmen,It appeareth by the proceſſe againſt the Waldenſes of Dauphiné, by Albert de Capitaneis, & other Monkes Inquiſitors. ſlow bellies, ſeducing and being ſeduced, they had done it: but there was neuer any as yet that hath occaſioned the leaſt troubles that may be in that regard. It well appeareth that in whatſoeuer depended on their owne wils, they haue neuer offered more or leſſe vnto thoſe people, taking no thought for their Maſſes and Trentals after their death: the which the Prieſts complaine of, and from thence take occaſion to accuſe them\nfor heretickes. And as touching reuenge, heare what they ſay.\n                     The Lord knowing that we ſhall be deliuered, ſaith:In the booke of the Waldenſes intituled of Tribulations. p. 274 Beware of men: but he doth not teach or counſell any of his choſen, to kill any, but rather to loue their enemies. When his diſciples ſaid vnto him, in the ninth of S. Luke, Wilt thou that we command that fire come downe from heauen, and conſume them? Chriſt anſwered and ſaid, Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of. Againe the Lord ſaith vnto Peter, Put vp thy ſword into thy ſheath, &c. For temporall aduerſities are to be contemned, and patiently to be endured, for there happeneth nothing therein that is new. We are here the Lords floore, to be beaten, as the come when it is ſeparated from the chaffe.\nThe laſt calumnie of the Waldenſes, which we haue gathered out of the writings of their aduerſaries, is that which Claud. Rubis layes vpon them as a foule aſperſion,\nClaud. Rubis in his hiſtorie of Lions. p. 269. in his Hiſtorie of the Citie of Lions. That being retired vnto the Alpes, at their departure from Lions they became like the reſt of the people of that countrey, beeſome riders.\nAnd he is not content to tie himſelfe to the Vaudois onely, but he addeth, Theſe are things that ordinarily follow one another, Hereſie and Sorcerie, as it is verified (ſaith he) in our times in thoſe Cities and Prouinces that haue giuen entertainment vnto hereſie.\nWe will firſt iuſtifie the Waldenſes, and then anſwer Rubis in the behalfe of thoſe Cities and Prouinces which he hath incloſed within this calumnie. All they offend againſt the firſt Commandemēt (ſay the Vandois in the expoſition of the firſt Commandemēt) that beleeue that the Planets can enforce the will of man. Theſe kind of men, as much as in them lies, accompt the Planets as\ngods; for they attribute vnto the creature, that which belongs vnto the Creator. Againſt which the Prophet Ieremie 10. ſpeaketh: Learne not the way of the heathen, and be not diſmayed at the ſignes of heauen, for the heathen are diſmayed at them. And S. Paul in the fourth to the Galathians, Ye obſerue moneths, and dayes, and times, and yeares: but I am afraid of you, leſt I haue beſtowed vpon you labour in vaine.\nAll they offend againſt this commandement, that beleeue Sorcerers and Soothſayers: for theſe men beleeue the diuels are gods. The reaſon is, becauſe they aske of diuels that which God alone can giue, that is, to manifeſt things hidden, and to foreſhew the truth of things to come, which is forbidden of God, Leuit. 19.31. Regard not them that haue familiar ſpirits, neither ſeeke after wizards to be defiled with them. And in the 20.6. The ſoule that turneth after ſuch as haue familiar ſpirits, and after wizards to go a whoring after them, I will ſet my face againſt that ſoule, and will cut him off from amongſt his people. And in the laſt verſe of that Chapter, A man or woman that hath a familiar ſpirit, or that is a wizard, ſhall ſurely be put to death; they ſhall ſtone them with ſtones, their bloud ſhall be vpon them.\n\nAs touching the puniſhment of this ſinne, and the vengeance that God taketh vpon ſuch a one, we reade in the 2. Kings 1.3. that the Angell of the Lord ſent vnto Elijah to meete the meſſengers of Ahaziah, and to ſay vnto them, Is it not becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the God of Ekron? and therefore ſaith the Lord in that place, Thou ſhalt not come downe from that bed on which thou art gone vp, but ſhalt ſurely die. Saul died, becauſe he had diſobeyed the commandement of God which he gaue vnto him: he regarded it\nnot, neither did he hope in the Lord, but tooke counſell of Sorcerers, for which cauſe the Lord tooke away his life, and transferred his kingdome vnto Dauid the ſonne of Iſhai.\nLet euery man therefore know, that all enchantment, or coniuration, or charme in writing, made to giue remedie to any kind of perſons or beaſts, is of no value, but is rather a ſnare of our ancient aduerſarie the diuell, by which he entrappeth and deceiueth mankind.\nHere you may ſee what the Waldenſes haue written againſt Sorcerers out of the word of God. It remaineth that we anſwer vnto that calumnie of Rubis, that it is apparent in our times, that hereſie and ſorcerie are inſeparably ioyned together, in thoſe Cities and Prouinces that haue giuen place vnto hereſie.\nHe taxeth without all doubt the Citie of Geneua, and the States of the Cantons that haue receiued the Goſpell, without any other ſhew of proofe, but that moſt commonly in thoſe places Sorcerers are cōdemned to death, following the commandement of God, which ſuffereth no Sorcerer to liue. He might farre better haue concluded, if he had ſaid that in thoſe places where the reformation of Religion was eſtabliſhed in our times, no man doth either conuerſe or hath acquaintance with Sorcerers, but ſo ſoone as any ſuch is found he is put to death: And therefore no man can affirme that to be true, except he will ſay, that to burne Sorcerers, is to ſupport them, and by the authoritie of the word to put them to death, be a kind of hereſie.\nIt is true indeed that in thoſe places hereſie and ſorcerie are ioyned together, where they that make profeſſion to teach the people are for the moſt part Sorcerers; whereof many men haue complained, who haue written\nwith a great deale of griefe, that which they knew to be put in practiſe by their Prieſts and Monks, yea by ſome of the Popes themſelues.\n                     \n\nBodin in his Demon. l. 4. c. 6. p. 211.\nBodin affirmeth, that there are infinite indictments in which it appeareth that the Prieſts many times are not onely Sorcerers, or at leaſt wiſe that Sorcerers haue intelligence with the Prieſts, but that they are content to ſay Maſſes for Sorcerers, fitting them with ſacrifices, conſecrating their parchments, putting rings vpon their grauen tombes, or other the like things vpon their altar, or vnder the linnen of the altar when they ſaid Maſſe.\n\n\nIohn Vuier in his booke of diuels. l. 4. chap. 3. fol. 303.\nIohn Vuier Phiſitian to the Duke of Cleue, though he made profeſſion of the Romiſh religion, writes as followeth. If the Paſtors of the Churches did ſtop vp the windowes of falſe doctrines and other impieties, they ſhould certainly haue (ſaith he) a wholſome preſeruatiue for thoſe that are vnder their charge againſt the ſubtle practiſes and impoſtures of the diuell, whereby they that are moſt vnaduiſed ſhould not be ſo often intangled as commonly we ſee them, to the great hurt and detriment of their ſoules; which cometh to paſſe, not onely by the negligence of the Prieſts, whom it moſt concerneth, & whoſe charge it is to looke vnto it, but alſo by their purſuite, counſell, peruerſe doctrine, and deceitfull working, by which they allure and draw the ſimple people to haue recourſe to vnlawfull remedies, as often as they are any way afflicted with ſudden, long, knowne and vnknowne maladies, proceeding from naturall cauſes, or from thoſe which are aboue nature: which turneth to the great ſcandall of the Church, conſidering that they make profeſſion to be Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and for the moſt part they are Prieſts or Monkes, whom men thinke to be ſuch, that\nit is a great wickedneſſe to haue the leaſt ill thought or opinion of them, ſince they ſhould ſerue for an example to their flocke, and conſidering they are Doctors and teachers; But perhaps (ſaith he) theſe Magicians thinke that this art belongs vnto them by a ſpeciall prerogatiue, and that they haue right thereunto by an hereditarie ſucceſſion, becauſe the Prieſts of Egypt (of whom Pithagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, Plato, haue learned their Magicke) were Negromancers. Now I thinke not, ſaith he, that they that will take vpon them to defend theſe Prieſts and the practiſe of their enchantments, are ſo audacious as to obiect vnto me diuers Popes of Rome skilfull in the Magicke art, affirming that they haue put it in practiſe to their great profit & comfort: ſuch as Siluester 2. was,\nPlatina in the life of Silueſter 2. fol. 218. printed at Paris ann. 1551. who as Platina and Nauclerus affirme, obtained the Popedome by that meanes: and ſuch as Benedict 9. in the yeare one thouſand three hundred and two, who before was named Theophilact, and after Maledictus,\n\nIohn Maire in his Hiſtorie of the Schiſmes of the Church ſaith, that all the Popes here ſpoken of were Sorcerers, Magicians and Negromancers. becauſe of his wickedneſſe. Such alſo as was Iohn 20. and Iohn 21. as Cardinall Benno writeth, who aided themſelues with their familiar friends, Laurentius, Gratian, and Hildebrand, all culpable of theſe enchantments. For all the Popes that were after Silueſter 2. vnto Gregory 7. who was a great and a famous Magician, and who (as Benno writeth) as oft as it ſeemed good vnto himſelfe, would ſhake his ſleeues in ſuch a manner, that ſparkles of fire ſhould come forth of them, whereby he blinded the eyes of the more ſimple and leſſe ſubtle, as if they had bene miracles and ſignes of ſanctitie. Such were all theſe Popes, as it is ſet downe in their liues, where you may alſo reade many execrable examples, whereby they wonne women to their loue, and were much giuen to offer abhominable ſacrifices vnto diuels in forreſts and mountaines.\n                     The Magicians then of our times, ſaith Vuier, muſt not thinke to couer themſelues vnder this mantell and pretence. But we haue reaſon to deplore the miſeries of theſe times, wherein we can hardly finde any men more wicked and leſſe puniſhed, then they that do alwayes admoniſh the ſimple people that the euils that happen vnto them are ſent by the permiſſion of God.\n                     Moreouer he complaineth that theſe coniuring Prieſts dare to vſe infinite blaſphemies, enriched with diuerſe croſſes figured with their curſed and ſacrilegious hands. As alſo of that vſe they make of their holy water, of their exorciſed ſalt, their conſecrated tapers at Eaſter, their candles and tapers at Candlemas againſt the diuell, with which he mockes them: as alſo the fumigations of holy bowes vpon Palme ſunday, and of herbes ſtuck vpon the doores vpon the day of Saint Iohn the Baptiſt, and the ſprinkling of holy water at the feaſt of the Aſſumption of the Virgin Mary. Moreouer ſuch Prieſts, ſaith he, abuſe the ſacrament of the Euchariſt to commit their villanies.\nHe likewiſe complaineth that Theologie and Phyſicke are polluted with coloured exorciſmes, by their mumbling of barberous words in an vnknowne tongue, by abuſing the word of God, by bands, neck-laces, and charmes, all which conſpire and procure the vtter ruine and damnation of men.\nMoreouer he ſaith, that the Prieſts haue very apparently made vſe of diuerſe apparitions of Sathan, affirming themſelues to be the ſoules of this or that man, and faining to be in the paines of Purgatory, for their owne particular profit. And when the diuell hath not ſufficiently furniſhed them, they haue counterfeited themſelues to be ſpirits, to draw the liuing to more frequent oblations, donations, and dotations, to ſatiate\ntheir auarice.\n                     \nLauater ſaith as much,\nLauater in his booke of the apparition of diuels, Chap. 14.7. and relates at large the hiſtory of the falſe ſpirit of Orleans, and of the Iacobins at Berne, which amongſt others were the moſt famous impoſtures of Monkes.\nThe famous Parliaments of Aix & Grenoble haue condemned vnto death diuerſe Prieſts that were ſorcerers, as namely, at Aix a certaine Hermit adored of the people for a Saint. And Lewes Godfrey, that famous Magician, beneficed in the Church of Acoules at Marſeilles, who was burnt in Prouence the laſt of Aprill, 1611. And at Grenoble Nobilibus a Monke, and a certaine Prieſt in the Dioceſſe of Ambrun, who baptized infants in the name of Baalzebub And therefore we may conclude, that foraſmuch as in theſe venerable Parliaments they haue condemned ſorcerers to death, which is not done elſewhere, they are to haue the blame that do it not, of which fault Rubis would ſeeme to taxe the States and Cities without exception. More modeſtie becomes a man then was in this paſſionate Rubis: for it is great reaſon, that among Prieſts ſuch ſhould be excepted, as God hath not ſo farre forth abandoned, as to ſuffer them to adhere to the ſorceries of Satan. This pratler ſhould haue thought, that either ſoone or late this calumnie would be retorted to his owne ſhame. He ſhould haue contented himſelfe with his reprochfull ſpeeches againſt the Waldenſes, of whom he hath belched many falſe reports, carried by the violence of his owne humour, and not haue laid aſperſions on the liuing: yea he ſhould bluſh to thinke that he hath giuen vs iuſt occaſion to retort vpon himſelfe and his wicked Prieſts, that which he would lay vpon thoſe that make profeſſion of the Goſpell, and that puniſh with death all ſorcerers: ſo farre are they from hauing\ncommunion or conuerſe with them. Thus you haue the iuſtification of the greateſt calumnies that haue bene layed vpon the Waldenſes by their owne writings, which may ſatisfie any man that is not carried with paſſion. It is neceſſarie that we now produce ſuch witneſſes, for the better defence of their innocencie, as are free from all ſuſpition.\n                  \n", "image_url": "A09486/00014.000.001.left.png", "label": "0"}

How did he rend and teare it to pieces? The ten firſt Perſecutions witneſſe to it; And what vaine things did the people of the Jewes imagine, when they thought to extinguiſh the light of the Goſpel, that ſhone in their Horiſon, and to extirpate the profeſſion of Chriſt out of their Coaſts? And ſecondly, How directly and particularly doth the holy Ghoſt point out unto us the ten Hornes that gave their power to the Beaſt, under the notion of the Kings of the earth ſetting themſelves againſt the Lord, and his anointed? How openly and ſtoutly the Kings of the earth have ſet themſelves againſt the Lord, and his anointed, in giving their power to maintaine the dominion, luſts, and blaſphemies of the man of ſin, is evident by the havock they have made in the Church of Chriſt theſe many hundred yeares. And laſtly, How exact and preciſe is the holy Ghoſt in deſcribing unto us by many notable Characters, the conſtitution of a third ſort of\nRulers, that ſhould come upon the ſtage of the world in the latter end of thoſe dayes, to finiſh the Tragedy of the old Serpent; yet, before the Kings of the earth ſhould be totally extinct, or put by from proſecuting their work; for while the remaining Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, theſe take counſell together againſt the Lord and his anointed.\n3 The Apoſtles and Brethren in the fourth of the Acts, are of our mind; they begin the fulfilling of this Propheſie with the firſt coming of Chriſt, when Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and people of Iſrael, were gathered together againſt Chriſt, in the twenty-ſeventh Verſe.\n4 As to the finiſhing-time of this Propheſie, we have good and ſure ground to receive it for a truth, that this Propheſie runs downe to the day of Chriſts power, when all the Kingdomes of this world ſhall become the Kingdomes of the Lords Chriſt. For,\n\n1 Here's the forbearance and long-ſufferance of God at an end: He ſpeaks to the world in wrath, and vexeth them in his ſore diſpleaſure; A courſe God takes not till he hath tryed all other wayes and means, and that indeed the world hath fill'd the cup of her iniquity almoſt full, and the myſtery of iniquity is almoſt finiſh't; then, God reſolves to make a full end of her, as he did of the old world, when the appointed time came: But\n2 Chriſt ſteps in, and by vertue of that authority he hath with his Father, he ſaith, he will declare the Decree: He procures a little ſuſpenſion of the devouring wrath of God, and undertakes to declare the Decree in the midſt of this wrathfull diſpenſation; now the Decree being onely concerning the matter of his Kingdome in the world, it's worthy our ſerious conſideration, whether it point at a time paſt, or the time preſent, or to come. PAST, I conceive it cannot be, for we doe not find that this Decree hath been declared in former times, accompanied with the weighty and materiall circumſtances in the Text, viz. Declared, as his right and Title to the Kingdomes and poſſeſſions of the Kings and Rulers of the earth; in oppoſition to the preſent Governours of the world, though the beſt and moſt Saint-like of them, who Take COƲNSELL againſt the Lord, and his anointed, that is, act againſt him hiddenly, that it appears not to the vulgar eye; and particularly addreſt to the Kings and Rulers of the world, as matter for their conſideration; denouncing no leſſe than periſhing, death, to thoſe that yeeld not to him; pronouncing them bleſſed, who forſaking their former Lords and Rulers, put their truſt in him: Now no time paſt being able to ſhew this Decree thus declared, therefore it cannot point out to us that part of time.\n3 Here is but a little time given men to repent in; which argues the day is far ſpent, and the night is at hand, the glaſſe is almoſt run out, there's but a few ſands behind to run; the voyce was all the day long, beſeeching and woeing to repentance, by loving and patheticall perſwaſions, We beſeech you, ſaith the Apoſtle, in Christs ſtead, ſetting before men the tenderneſſe of the heart of Chriſt to ſinners, and that matchleſſe love of his that mov'd him to ſhed his blood for them; pourtraying before them in a lively manner a crucified Chriſt, with his Crowne of Thornes on his head, his wounds in his hands and ſides, blood and water guſhing out, and all this (with the merits of his death and ſufferings) to perſwade men to believe the willingneſſe of the heart of Chriſt to ſave ſinners, and that they would come and take him upon his owne tearmes, that they may be made happy by him. But now the day is ſo far ſpent, the evening come, and the time for repentance almoſt expired, the voyce is altered, as we ſee in the laſt Verſe of the Pſalme, Kiſſe the Son leaſt he be angry, &c. A haſty exhortation to repentance, and ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, from the conſideration of his anger; it's but a little time he will waite for you, if you come not in to him, when his wrath is kindled but a little, you will periſh from the way, then they will be onely bleſſed, that have put their truſt in him. This Text holds a faire correſpondencie with that in Rev. 22.11, 12. He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill: And he that is righteous, let him be righteous ſtill; and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill. And behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his worke ſhall be. And that other followes at the back of it, Bring hither thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould raigne over them, and ſlay them before me.\n\n4 We have cloſely coucht in this Pſalme, ſome ſignes of the coming of Chriſt, as The Apoſtacy and falling away of many (as appears by what followes) and the abounding of iniquity, upon which the love of many ſhall wax cold; for certainly, iniquity muſt very much abound, when ſuch perſons as theſe Rulers are (who they be, and what they are, will be made manifeſt by and by) ſhall take counſell together to break the bands of the Lord, and his anointed, and caſt their cords from them: Which manifeſts that the love they once made ſhew of, is very cold indeed.\n5 Here's a time ſpoken of, wherein Chriſt ſhall deale with the Kings and Rulers of the earth, concerning the matters of his Kingdome, and provoke them to give place to him, whoſe right it is. All the day long, he had been dealing with men promiſcuouſly, but now he is taking tohimſelfe his great power the father hath given him, he deales in a ſpeciall and more then ordinary manner, with the Kings and Rulers of the earth.\nLaſtly, This Pſalme ſeems by the ſtile of it, to preſent to us Gods coming to judge the world; God coming downe to view the works of mens hands (as he did to Sodome, to ſee what men did there) and beholding the abominable wickedneſſes of men, he asks the reaſon of it, why it is ſo? and finding none to give an account, no Advocate to plead their cauſe, (his Son not appearing for them) he breaks forth into wrath and fury againſt the world, reſolves to delay no longer, but to execute the Decree, performe his Promiſe to his Son, and powre downe his judgements upon the world: Sitting on his Throne, he laughs at them, hath them in deriſion, ſpeaks to them in wrath, and vexes them in his ſore diſpleaſure.\n\n\nWhoſoever doth ſeriouſly ponder and weigh theſe Reaſons, I conceive will ſee cauſe to believe it for a Truth, That this Propheſie takes in all that ſpace of time between Chriſts firſt and ſecond coming.\nBut in the ſecond place, There is ſome ſpeciall particle of time, pointed out unto us by that ſignificant THEN in the fifth verſe: THEN ſhall he ſpeake unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure. THEN, when? The holy Ghoſt affords us by the favourable Aſpect of this THEN, many Characters to guide us into a competent knowledge of that diſmall time.\n\nTHEN, may have reſpect unto the heatheniſh rage, and vaine imaginations of the firſt company of enemies; and it ſignifies thus much, that when the rage of the one, and folly of the other came to the full, THEN God would judge them; and truly, at that time God put the old Dragon to his ſhifts, he had been quite extinct, and put beſide his Kingdome, had he not evaded it, by giving his power to the Beaſt (Antichriſt) and being contented to raigne by his ſubſtitute, the man of ſin; but in a ſpeciall and peculiar manner this remarkable THEN, hath reſpect unto the laſt of thoſe counterfeits, that would be eſteemed Gods Deputies, yet are in truth Satans Inſtruments, againſt the Lord and his anointed. So that,\n\n\n1 THEN when the RƲLERS take counſell together. RƲLERS, men that are neither of the number of the Heathen, nor of the Kings of the earth, but a more refined ſort of men; ſuch, as would be accounted Judges as at the firſt, and counſellours as at the beginning. RƲLERS, not of the earth, no, that is not expreſt, onely there are Kings of the earth; but theſe counſellors are RƲLERS; of what?ſurely it's but genuine to ſay, they would be accounted Rulers of the Lords people: But Chriſt when he comes to deale with them in the tenth verſe, ſaith, they are of the earth as well as the Kings, Judges of the EARTH: He diſcovers their hidden works of darkneſſe, and makes them appear in their true colours; Thus much I conceive is ſignified to us by this, that though when Chriſt comes to ſpeak to them, he calls them, as indeed they are, Judges of the earth; yet here they are termed onely Rulers, (and that in oppoſition to the Kings of the earth) that is, ſuch as they termed themſelves, and would be eſteemed.\n               \nRƲLERS, Counſellors: No Heatheniſh Emperors, nor Popiſh Kings, but refined Rulers; here's Satan transformed into an Angel of light; The Heathens cannot prevaile, and the Kings of the earth doe not proſper, thus Satan being put to his laſt ſhift, turnes Saint in ſhew, ſets up his Rulers, that have neither the violent rage of the Heathen, nor the open prophaneſſe of the Kings, but the ſoft hand of profeſſion, to become nurſing fathers, and nurſing mothers to the Church of Chriſt, (as appears by what followes) even while they are taking counſell together againſt the Lord and his anointed: For,\nThey are RƲLERS, that having cut off ſome of the Kings of the earth, Rule in their ſtead: which is neceſſarily imply'd in the Text, for we know that the Kings of the earth (thoſe that committed fornication with the Beaſt, and gave their power to her, Rev. 17.2.17.) ruled over the whole world (that part which is called the Chriſtian world, in which this conteſt is, betweene Chriſt and his enemies) yet at laſt ſteps up ſome Rulers, and they get Dominion among the Kings; for it's clear by the Order of the words in the Text, theſe Rule, and take counſell, while the reſt of the Kings are ſetting themſelves againſt the Lord and his anointed: which could not be, if theſe Rulers had not deſtroyed ſome of the Kings, ruling in their ſtead; otherwiſe, there would be no place for them, the Kings of the earth having all the Chriſtian world under their Dominion, it's no way reaſonable to conceive, that thoſe who love their Crownes ſo well, would willingly give their glory to others.\nAnd why may we not ſay, that theſe Rulers get their Dominion by fighting the Lambs battels againſt the Beaſt; for, A Kingdome divided againſt it ſelfe cannot ſtand; If Satan be againſt Satan, how can he proſper? Therefore it's not reaſonable to think, that Satan ſhould ſet them on work to deſtroy his Kings, but that theſe Rulers did fight upon the account of Chriſt, and his people.\nAgaine, Satan is on the looſing hand by theſe Rulers, for, as Satan was not ſo viſible nor ſo abſolute in his rule over the world, in the Beaſts time, as in the Dragons; ſo now he looſes more ground in the loſſe of his Kings, then when he loſt his Dragon; and can it be thought the wiſe Serpent would doe himſelfe this miſchief? Further, if theſe had gone out to warre upon any lower account, they would have been Kings ſtill; as we ſee dayly, when one King is gone, another gets up into his ſeat, yet but a King; certainly, it's ſome weighty reaſon, that moves them to forſake the glorious Title of a King, and make ſuch refined pretenſions, as the very name Ruler (conſidering it ſtands in the Text in oppoſition to the preceding Heathens and Kings) ſignifies to us they will be forc't to.\nAgaine, They are RƲLERS, that have given profeſt ſubjection to the Scepter of Chriſt: That is hinted to us in the third verſe, Let us breake their bands aſunder: That theſe bands can be no other but that part of the yoke of Chriſt to which they have ſubmitted, thoſe Lawes and Commands of Chriſt to which they have ſubjected themſelves, being convinced in their conſciences it was their duty ſo to doe: is clear to me upon theſe grounds.\n1 Otherwiſe the holy Ghoſt ſhould commit Tautology, and unneceſſary redundancy of ſpeech; for Interpreters (and that according to the truth) expound theſe bands and cords, mention'd in the Text, to be no other then the Lawes and Commands of Chriſt: And would it not be a derogating from the glory of this bleſſed word of God, and that excellent ſignificancy that is in every tittle of it, to ſay, that theſe two manner of expreſſions, ſignifie but one and the ſame thing, to give to it no more than a bare elegancy of ſpeech? Surely then, one part of the verſe would be ſuperfluous, and may be left out, which God forbid: This were to charge the word of God, and ſo God himſelfe, with that imperfection vaine man is ſubject to; which I preſume none that profeſſes himſelfe a Chriſtian dares to doe. And if this be granted (which cannot be denyed) that there is a weighty ſignificancy in both parts of the verſe; then\n2 What more genuine Interpretation can be given? For how come the Lawes of Chriſt to be bands to a man, but by his being actually bound with them? As the cords and withes wherewith Sampſon was bound, were not his bands before he became bound with them; they were cords and withes before, but then they were his bands, which he brake in ſunder: They cannot be called a mans bands in reſpect of the duty that lyes upon him to yield obedience to them, for ſo they are called\ncords, which theſe men endeavour to caſt away from them. A man becomes bound, either by Covenant, Oath, Vow, or Engagement; when a man ſhall make a Covenant to walk in obedience to ſuch and ſuch Lawes, and bind himſelfe to the performance of it with an Oath; when he ſhall make a Vow, and engage to doe ſuch and ſuch things; though theſe duties and obligations were but cords before, yet now by theſe tyes upon him, they are become his bands; theſe Rulers, being thus tyed and bound, take counſell together to breake theſe bands aſunder, and to caſt away the cords from them, that they are not as yet bound with.\n               \nObject. If it be objected, That in the Text it's ſaid, Their bands, that is, the bands of the Lord and his anointed, ſo that they cannot be the bands of the Rulers.\n\nI Anſwer:\n\n1 It's brought in as the ſpeech of the Rulers, and ſo I conceive holds forth unto us their Apoſtacy, who now in an opprobrious ſcorn, call them their bands, thereby denying that they were at all obliged to the obſervance of them: Or\n2 By this terme, their bands, may be intimated to us thoſe Lawes of Chriſt, which Chriſt by the common and ordinary workings of his ſpirit, had wrought in theſe Rulers ſome kind of love to, which moved them to a ſubjection to them; or, by his providence had neceſſitated them ſo to doe, otherwiſe they ſaw they could not proſper in their work; or, that the people of God, Chriſts anointed, by their exhortations, calling upon them, and that formidable aſſiſtance they gave unto them while they ſtood for Chriſt againſt Satan in his Kings, had obliged them to be bound with; ſo that theſe may be truly called their bands, becauſe they are the cords, with which the Lord and his anointed have bound them; of which they cannot be freed, except they break them: yet ſtill they are the Rulers bands, which they take counſell together to break. Therefore\n3 The conſideration of the different carriage of theſe Rulers, towards the bands and the cords, will add ſome further ſatisfaction; they will breake their bands, and caſt away their cords; if the bands had no more tye upon them than the cords, the ſame ſlight manner of carriage of theirs towards the cords, would ſerve them alſo to be rid of the bands: But it's far otherwiſe, though they think a bare caſting and putting away, will clear them of the cords; yet, they are ſenſible, the bands cleave ſo cloſe to them, they cannot be rid of them, unleſſe they break them; as Sampſon could not be free from his cords and withes,wherewith he was bound untill he had broken them: If they had not ſo obliged themſelves to the Lawes of Chriſt, as that they were bound by them, what need they take counſell to break them; a man needs not ſtand to break a cord to clear himſelfe of it, except he be bound therewith; if onely a proffer be made to bind him with it, he may put it by, and caſt it from him, that is eaſier for him ſo to doe, and will ſerve the turne, as here in the Text they conſult to doe; but if he be once bound with it, nothing but a forcible breaking of it will free him: So that this carriage of theirs, towards the bands and the cords, confirms our Aſſertion.\n\nYet notwithſtanding this their profeſſed ſubjection to Chriſt, theſe Rulers turne Apoſtates; Satan debauches them, then entring into them, makes them his owne, to finiſh his warfare, to fight for him, though after another manner, in a more ſubtill method then formerly, bringing forth the very maſterpiece of Satans wiſedome, for we ſee here, they take Counſell together, againſt the Lord and his anointed.\n\n2 THEN, when the Rulers take COƲNCELL: Counſell, in diſtinction from, and oppoſition to, the mad rage of the Heathen, and the open and publick boldneſſe of the Kings; theſe two kinds of vaſſals not thriving in their way, Satan runs to his Saintlike Rulers, as to a ſure refuge, his Counſellors; and they take counſell, a ſecret clandeſtin way, as expert Warriours, when great ſhot will not doe, againſt the wall of a City, or Fort, then they ſecretly undermine it, ſuppoſing to prevaile that way: a ſecret way, They will not ſcruple to tranſgreſſe the regular punctillio's of the Law in any caſe, but, from counſell to action preſently, before their counſells may be knowne: Theſe take counſell, which way is beſt to be taken, what the moſt wiſe and prudent courſe may be, to accompliſh their deſigne by; if by any way, by any means or courſe whatſoever, they can have their will, and ſtabliſh themſelves, though it be never ſo wicked and unworthy. If no other way will ſerve, they will become Saints of the higheſt form: in ſhew, Pauls brethren, become all things to all men, that they may gaine ſome, for, they take counſell; and if need be (keeping a ſuitable decorum) ſpeak and act againſt all thoſe, though never ſo excellent in their Generation, that ſtand in the way of their deſignments.\nTo find out ſome new and neat way, the ſteps of their Predeceſſors they will not exactly follow; no, they have ſeen the folly and weaknes of thoſe: But they ſeek after a curious piece of Art, whereby they may be able to doe that which all the world before them (their great grand-fathersthe Heathen, and their fore-fathers the prophane Kings of the earth) could not doe, againſt the Lord and his anointed: They take counſell, they have wiſedome (though from below) with them; for the Scripture ſaith, Where there's counſell there's wiſedome: They are the wiſeſt and moſt ſubtill inſtruments ever Satan made uſe of; they are Counſellors, ſuch as God who is wiſedome it ſelfe, thinks it high time for him to ariſe and diſappoint them, leaſt they prevaile againſt his beloved.\n               3 THEN, when the Rulers take Counſell TOGETHER; when there is a Combination and Confederacy in Counſells between theſe refined Rulers againſt the Lord and his anointed: when they ſhall combine together to make their hands ſtrong, that they may keep their Dominion, maugre all the oppoſition, the Lord and his holy ones make.\n4 THEN, when the Rulers take counſell together AGAINST THE LORD AND HIS ANOINTED; that is Chriſt and his followers, his anointed ones with the unction of the ſpirit, that follow him in all his out-goings, againſt the backſlidings and Apoſtacies of theſe Rulers: True, the Apoſtles and Brethren in the fourth of the Acts, expound this of the father, and Chriſt the Son, that the father was this Lord, and Chriſt the anointed of his father; this they ſpake of the gathering together of the Heathen and Jewes againſt Chriſt, when they put him to death; but the father having given all power into his Sons hands, hath made him both Lord and Chriſt, as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks in Acts 2.36. The father in recompence for his finiſhing that which he gave him to doe, hath made him Lord, and anointed him above his fellowes; and he aſcending up on high, gave his gifts unto the Sons of men, anointing them according to his promiſe, with the unction of the ſpirit; and let the Prophet David expound his owne meaning, ſaith he in another place, The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand (which Chriſt applies to himſelfe) ſo that David underſtood Chriſt to be Lord. Againe, Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme; the anointed are his Prophets, and his Prophets are his anointed, and who theſe Prophets are, we may ſee in the Epiſtle to the Corinthians, they are the Members of the Church of Chriſt; ſo that David Expounds his owne meaning, and clearly expreſſes himſelfe, to point out Chriſt and his anointed, in theſe words. Now the reaſon why I terme them the followers of Chriſt in ſome ſpeciall deſigne, is, becauſe if all the Lords Prophets be anointed, thenmuch more thoſe, (they have a greater meaſure of the anointing,) who follow the Lamb in his ſometimes rough, uncouth wayes of his providences, who keep cloſe to him when he is doing his ſtrange work, and bringing to paſſe his ſtrange act in the world, when he comes to take the Kingdomes of this world unto himſelfe, whoſe right it is to raigne: And they are with him againſt theſe Rulers, is ſtrongly imply'd, in that theſe Rulers are ſo cloſe in conſultation, and ſo fully bent againſt them; for, we cannot conceive, that theſe wiſe men would irritate any againſt them without a cauſe, but on the other hand, they wil foſter all that will come under their wing, and take protection from them; and truly, it's not a ſmall portion of this anointing will deliver them from the intanglements of theſe Rulers; for they are Saints as to us (or at leaſt to thoſe who have not a very narrow and quick inſpection into the ſtate of the times) the faireſt outſide ever Satan had; And without doubt many of the people of the Lord may be taken and deceived with them: Some good thing they will doe (or they'le prove but fooliſh Counſellors) they will goe as far to meet a diſſenting Brother, as it's poſſible for them, and not endanger their Dominion. If Satan cannot uphold his Dragon, he will be content with his Beaſt; but if he cannot keep up his Beaſt in any place, he will be ſatisfied with his Image; yea, rather than give out, the bare number of his name ſhall pleaſe him: So that many precious ſoules may be deluded for a time, if they take not great heed, otherwiſe that voyce would be needleſſe, Come out of her my people, leaſt ye be partakers of her ſins, and ſo of her plagues.\n5 THEN, when they Take counſell together, to BREAK THEIR BANDS ASƲNDER, AND TO CAST AWAY THEIR CORDS FROM THEM. The conteſt goes high, by this time it's come to particulars: Before, it was but in generalls; and it's about no ſmall or triviall buſineſſe, but who ſhall have the Authority and power; The diſpute is about the Kingdome (that is clear from the whole Pſalme; ſaith God, Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion: And the Decree is wholly concerning Chriſts Kingdome over the world) about the Authority and Legiſlative power; Chriſt and his anointed ſay, the father hath given them authority to bind Kings with chaines, and Nobles with fetters of iron; to bind the Rulers with his Lawes, as with a cord; and theſe Rulers take counſell together to break their bands aſunder, and caſt their cords from them. We have already given our ſence what theſe bands are.\nTheſe Rulers take counſell to BREAK THEM ASƲNDER.ſurely they had need of a greater than Sampſons ſtrength, that would break the bands of God aſunder; but theſe think to doe it by ſlights and wiles, they take counſell: They would breake their bands, although they be bound by the ſtrongeſt Oathes and Obligations, the largeſt Vowes and Declarations, the greateſt proteſtations and profeſſions, yet they muſt be broken rather than the Lord and his anointed ſhall have their due, and their right.\n               And to CAST AWAY THEIR CORDS; what though theſe cords be the moſt righteous, holy and wholeſome Lawes of the great Jehovah, (that will bleſſe thoſe with the greateſt happineſſe, that live in unfeigned obedience to them) that the Lord and his anointed would impoſe on them for their owne good and ſalvation; they will none of them, but take counſell to caſt them away, ſcorning and deriding them as a burden too heavy for man to bear, a yoke not fit for the neck of ſuch a free Creature as man is: Breake their bands, and caſt away their cords, that they may have no power over them, that they may be their ſubjects, and not their Lords, that they may not intrench upon their Dominion, nor deprive them of their worldly enjoyments.\n6 THEN, when they TAKE COƲNCELL: Before they proceed to act; when upon conſultation they are ready to goe forth in all their might, crying, LET ƲS breake their bands, &c. Then God will ariſe and ſhew himſelfe, he will not ſuffer them to act their counſels leaſt they prevaile, but while they are in counſell, he will take them to task, and let them find he can in wrath tumble them into thoſe pits and ſnares they have digged for others.\n7 THEN, when the Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſell together againſt the Lord and his anointed. The order of the words, in that the Holy Ghoſt brings in the Kings ſetting themſelves, and the Rulers taking counſell together, before he tells us againſt whom; ſeems to me to be of ſufficient force to perſwade us, that here is a hint given us by the Holy Ghoſt, of another confederacy, that there ſhall be ſome agreement between the (remaining) Kings of the earth (or at leaſt ſome of them) and theſe Rulers, againſt the Lord and his anointed; and then will God ariſe, bear with them no longer, but ſpeak to them in his wrath.\n\nLaſtly, THEN, when their Counſells ſhall be guilty of ſuch a degree of Apoſtacy, as moves God to laugh at them; when they ſet at naught the counſell and reproof of God (which ſurely is contain'd inthoſe bands and cords they reject) then, will God deale with them in that dreadfull manner mentioned, Prov. 1.24—ult. Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regardded: But ye have ſet at nought all my counſell, and would none of my reproof, I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your feare cometh. When your feare cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlewind; when diſtreſſe and anguiſh cometh upon you; Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeeke me early, but they ſhall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the feare of the Lord; they would none of my counſell, they deſpiſed all my reproofe. Therefore ſhall they eate of the fruit of their owne way, and be filled with their owne deviſes; for the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fooles ſhall deſtroy them.\nAnd when the abomination of their counſells come to that height, that God ſhall have them in deriſion, which is ſomewhat more then to laugh; It may poſſibly be, that a man may laugh at one (and that in anger too) whom he yet loves; but to laugh with deriſion, argues perfect hatred: When their counſells and doings againſt the Lord, thus provoke the eyes of his glory, THEN, ſhall be ſpeake to them in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure.\n\nAnd if we would know when God will thus laugh at them, and have them in deriſion; The anſwer is plaine in the Text, he will doe it, upon their taking counſel to break their bands aſunder, and to caſt away their cords from them: when the cry is, Let us breake their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us: He that ſitteth in the heavens ſhall laugh; the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.\n\nThus we ſee what a multitude of plaine Characters the Holy Ghoſt hath given of that time wherein God will come upon the world, and doe ſuch great things for his Son (who he hath made Lord, and ſet at his right hand) and his anointed ones: When we ſee theſe Characters written on the foreheads of the high ones of the earth, then we may ſafely ſay without haeſitation, That God will ſuddenly come in wrath and fury, take their Dominion away, and give it to that rejected corner ſtone, whoſe right it is to raigne.\n\n\n\nLet us now make a ſtand, and by a ſerious review, ſee what may be obſerved as a beneficiall Leſſon for us to learne.\n1 That in theſe latter diſpenſations, men may fill up the meaſure of their iniquity, and bring judgement upon their Generation, by a bare taking counſell againſt the Lord and his anointed. When the Rulers takecounſell together, then, God will ſpeake unto them in wrath.\n\n2 How Great matter of Comfort is it to the people of God, the followers of the Lamb, that their father is ſo far from ſuffering their enemies to prevaile againſt them in theſe laſt dayes, that All that ever they can doe cannot prevaile to breake one band aſunder, (that is, ſo, as to free themſelves from it, to ſettle themſelves upon another foundation) but while they are taking counſell together, God comes and gives them the rout, let's them heare his mighty voyce in wrath, that they run to the holes of the rock, and cry to the mountaines and to the hills to hide them from the tempeſt of his fury: He will take the crafty in their owne ſnares, though they take counſell to draw the Lords people into their ſnares, and to throw them into the pits they have digged; yet, ſhall they not be able to bring it to paſſe, but they themſelves ſhall be taken with, and fall into them; then the ſcourge ſhall teach them Nebuchadnezzar's leſſon, That the moſt high rules in the Kingdomes of men: In former times, his long-ſufferance was much, he lets them goe on to rage and madneſſe, to open and bold (yea, and prevalent) acting, ſetting themſelves againſt them; but now, his patience will waite no longer, he will deale with them, before they are well warme in their counſells; He will cut the worke ſhort in righteouſneſſe, becauſe a ſhort worke will the Lord make upon the earth; thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortned for the Elect's ſake.\n\n3 What a darke and diſtracting day, is this day? When ſuch men as theſe Rulers have appear'd to be, having followed the Lamb ſo far, to the cutting off ſome of the Kings of the earth, and proclaiming the Lord to be King, made his cords (his Lawes) to become their bands, binding themſelves with them (as hath been open'd at large) when ſuch men ſhall now turne head, and deale ſubtilly with the Lord and his anointed, taking counſell againſt them: What a darke day of Apoſtacy is this day? The Dragon is able to caſt downe a third part of the Stars to the earth; and when the Stars fall from heaven, what bitterneſſe will betide the Children of men? Without queſtion theſe Rulers by their malevolent influence, will throw downe many who have been as ſhining lights, to the loſſe of their glorious profeſſion.\nHow great will be the diſtracting darkneſſe of this day? When the cunning of theſe Counſellors (working underboard) not ſhewing openly their intentions, ſhall amuſe men, that the moſt ſharp-ſighted obſerver, can ſcarcely diſcerne the temper of the times, ſo, as to demonſtrate the truth of his obſervation to the underſtanding of others, (forwe muſt remember that Satan now is at his laſt game, though men refuſe to worſhip the Beaſt, and to receive his mark, yet if they keep but within the number of his name, he will eſteem them as his good ſubjects, and be therewith content.) Here are Devils in the ſhape of Saints, carrying things in ſuch a poſture, as that almoſt all men are in a maze, not knowing what to dream the iſſue of things will be; ſurely, this day may truly be called neither day nor night, neither Satans night of darkneſſe, nor Gods day of light, in which men not having light enough to ſee clearly, nor wiſedome enough to light up their Candles, goe poreing in the dark, ready to ſtumble at every ſtraw of infirmity they meet with in the ſincere hearts of the times, in the mean while hazard a choaking, ſwallowing downe the Camels of State abominations; yet, notwithſtanding all this, God hath promiſed that at evening time it ſhall be light.\nWhat a diſtracting day of diviſion is this, among Gods own people? When ſome good ſoules exerciſing their charity ſhall conſider the Rulers former good actions, and plead them, with their apprehenſions of their preſent good intentions in what they doe, to thoſe, who being of a quicker inſight into the ſtate of buſineſſes, ſhall diſcover and aſſert their Apoſtacies, to perſwade them into a favourable conſtruction of their proceedings; and when on the other ſide, thoſe, who retaining their ſincerity in the life of it, being enlightened by the ſpirit of God in the worke of the day, both as to the work God would have done, and the counter-workings of the evill one, ſhall cry out amaine againſt thoſe abominations, that God may not be without witneſſe to the vindication of his honour, which men would lay in the duſt: what inward fends and heart-burnings? What breach of all Goſpel rules, will be the ſad fruit of this diſmall day? Let none ſay theſe things are far fetcht, and have no connexion with the Text, if men will ſeriouſly with unbiaſſed judgements weight the ground-work, I conceive they cannot but ſee theſe things a neceſſary deduction from the premiſes.\n4 The great faithfullneſſe and love of God to his Son Jeſus Chriſt his anointed one, that although out of his long-ſuffering he bore long with men, in their actings againſt his Son in the conteſt concerning his Prieſtly and Propheticall Office (though then at his appointed time he met with them to their confuſion) yet, when it comes to the matter of his Kingdome, which the father is ſo ſtrongly engaged to give him, and wherein his honour and glory is ſo abundantly concerned, THEN, will he waite no longer, but even while they are taking counſell, whilethey are but thinking of it, while they are conſulting the wiſeſt and moſt feaſible way to bring to paſſe their purpoſes; it ſo enrages the eyes of his glory to behold it, that he will not ſuffer them to break ſo much as a piece of a band, but he will make bare his arme, and ſpeak to them in wrath, by the mighty working of his power; The Lord will breake the ſtaffe of the wicked, and the Scepter of the Rulers.\n5 It's worthy our obſervation, That thoſe who bring up the reare of the enemies of the Lord and his anointed, are Counſellors. Or if you will thus, That the laſt (and ſo the moſt ſubtill refined) deſigne of Satan againſt the Lord and his anointed, is managed by A COƲNCILL. They take counſell together; ſuch, as having the example of all the feates of policy former times have brought forth, and the advantage of that patterne of prudence and wiſedome, the old ſubtill Serpent hath been drawing from the beginning of the world to this day, ſhall be ſo crafty and wylie, as that God by that ſhall be engaged to rouſe up himſelfe in his might, leaſt they prevaile; The Rulers of the world taking counſell, become wiſe againſt the Lord and his anointed; Their exceſſe in humane wiſedome and policy, engages God to ſhew forth the ſuper-excellency of his Divine wiſedome, being above them in that wherein they deale proudly.\n6 Although the fins of theſe Rulers be not ſo groſly prophane as their predeceſſors, but their thred is of a finer ſpin; yet, they are guilty of ſuch aggravations as the Lord Jeſus cannot brooke: They provoke him (him who is the onely Mediator for ſinners) that he will not ſpeak one word to his father on their behalfe; Though God come with fury in his face, asking the reaſon of their doings, why is it ſo? and his wrath wax hot againſt them, we ſee our Lord Jeſus appears not, pleads not a ſillable for them, we read not a word of his interceſſion in this place: Formerly notwithſtanding their ſins were more groſſe, and far greater in themſelves, to the ſlaying the Lord of glory, he prayes, Father forgive them, for they know not, what they doe; and the Martyrs (as Stephen did) could beg on behalfe of their murderers, Lord lay not this ſin to their charge: But now men are become wiſe, knowing ſinners againſt his glory, Hypocrites, be hath not a word to ſpeak for them, all that he will doe is to declare the Decree [I will declare the Decree] to the world and them, if they will hear, well, but if not, they ſhall feele his wrath, and periſh from the way.\n\n7 That when the world and its Rulers come to this manner and meaſure of ſin, they are excluded the interceſſion of Chriſt, (he prayesnot for them, neither is it the fathers mind he ſhould; when God puts him upon asking, it's not any thing for them, but their poſſeſſions and uſurpations for himſelfe, and a rod of iron to puniſh and deſtroy them) and ſo the prayers of the Saints. We ought not to pray for them, and for that, for whom and for which Chriſt prayed not; his interceſſion ought to be the patterne of our prayers; otherwiſe our petitions are not acceptable, for, in his beloved he accepts us. It hath been ſeverall times at this paſſe with the world, Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make interceſſion to me, for I will not hear thee. God loves not to hear his people make ſuch requeſts, he hath no mind to grant; Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet my mind could not be towards this people; caſt them out of my ſight, and let them goe forth. Though theſe three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they ſhould deliver but their owne ſoules by their righteouſneſſe, ſaith the Lord God. And now it's come into the ſame predicament againe; the world hath run its round, and is gotten into a like poſture it was in when a flood of wrath overwhelmed it: What a ſad condition is this world now in? It's tottering and there's none to underprop it; it's ſinking and there's none to uphold it; The wrath of God is hovering over it, ready to fall upon it, and there's none to plead, to undertake for it; Surely the world is beholding to the interceſſion of Chriſt for its ſtanding, and now that ceaſes, the foundations thereof are out of courſe, and it's falling: The day of the Lord is coming upon it as a Theef in the night, wherein the Heavens ſhall flee away as a ſcrowle, the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, and the earth with the workes therein ſhall be burnt up.\n\n\nThe ſecond part of our work is, To ſearch into the worke to be done in this remarkable time: Here is the work of the father, and of the Son.\n1 The work of the father, which is two-fold, A worke of wrath to his enemies; which is amplified by a double expreſſion, ſpeaking in wrath, and vexing them in his ſore diſpleaſure: And ſecondly, A work of love and faithfullneſſe to his Son.\n\nThen ſhall he ſpeake unto them in his wrath. God ſpeaks to men in divers manners, by the voyce of his providences, the voyce of his mercies, the voyce of his rod, and the voyce of his judgements; and when God ſpeaks by all in wrath, his providences blinding their eyes, his mercies hardening their hearts, his rod driving them from him, and (as the fruit of the former) his judgements ceaſe upon them; here's adreadfull day of wrath indeed, now God ſpeaks to them in wrath: But his hath ſpeciall relation to the voyce of his ward; for, what doth he peak to them in wrath? The Text tells us, Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Syon; the Goſpel of the Kingdome: And that muſt needs be a day of wrath and terrors indeed, when that word which was wont to be a word of ſalvation, a word of love and good will, ſhall now be a word of wrath, in wrath. O ſad!\n            \n\nGod ſpeaks his word in wrath to a people.\n1 When it hath contrary effects upon them; a ſavour of death unto death, inſtead of a ſavour of life unto life: As in Iſa. 6.9, 10, 11, 12. This Evangelicall Prophet Eſay, muſt make the hearts of this people fat, their eares heavy, and ſhut their eyes; and that by ſpeaking ſuch gracious words unto them as he doth throughout his whole Propheſie: Certainly, this is none other but the wrath of God upon a wanton and backſliding people.\n\n2 When God layes ſtumbling-blocks before a people, that they receive not nor hearken to the word, but ſtumble and fall upon it, and periſh, according to that in Jer. 6.21. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, behold, I will lay ſtumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the ſons together ſhall fall upon them: The neighbour and his friend ſhall periſh. This alſo is none other but the wrath of God upon a ſtubborne rebellious people: They had ſaid they would not heare, and ſaith God let it be ſo, they ſhall not heare; he throwes ſtumbling-blocks in their way, leaſt they ſhould follow the voyce of his word, and he ſhould bleſſe them: Yet theſe ſtumbling-blocks are not ſuch, as in the leaſt extenuate or leſſen their iniquity, by giving them good and right ground to plead a neceſſity for their doings, but ſuch, as men make to themſelves: True, God layes ſtumbling-blocks before them, yet it's themſelves that make thoſe ſo to them; they are not ſo to a ſanctified heart, (he, by the wing of faith can fly over them) but to an earthy lump of clay, whoſe eye is fixed upon no higher than a carnall and worldly glory: As\n\n1 Gods making uſe of obſcure mean fooliſh inſtruments (in the worlds eye) to publiſh his word and Decree to the world: He hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe, the weake to confound thoſe which are mighty, and the baſe and deſpiſed things of the world, and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. This hath been his courſe all along ſince the world began, none muſt deliver his people from a devouringfamine, but a deſpiſed Joſeph; The Meſſage of rebuke and threatning judgement to a Prince in Iſrael (good old Ely) muſt be ſent by Samuel a weak Child, unskilfull in the word of Propheſie: And as if none of the Princes and Royall blood could be moulded after Gods owne heart, he muſt take David from the ſheepfold, and make him (a mean ſhepheard) Governour over and a deliverer of his choſen people; And who are his Heralds to proclaime the Goſpel of the Kingdome, but a company of poore deſpicable Fiſhermen? He leaves the wiſe and learned Rabbies, Scribes, and holy Phariſees of the times, and chooſeth the fooles of the world, makes them prevalent to pull downe Principalities, powers, and ſtrong holds, and they ſhall one day prevaile to the trampling their enemies under their feet as the mire in the ſtreets. Thus, out of the mouths of Babes and ſucklings, he ordaining ſtrength, perfecting his praiſe, the ſpirituall man can diſcerne the glory of it, his heart will admire and adore it; But the men of this world, they take offence, ſtumble and fall to the periſhing of their ſoules: What! will God forſake our wiſe and holy men, that excell in moſt excellent virtues, and ſpeak by ſuch Idiots, raſh fooles, vainebablers, and mad men as they are? No, they cannot, they will not believe it: If Peter and his brethren be filled with the holy Ghoſt, they are drunken: If Paul ſpeak of the true God, he is a vaine-babler: and reaſon of Temperance and Judgement to come, much learning hath made him mad; This is the ſence and judgement of the world.\n2 The infirmities of his Meſſengers; their not walking up fully to their profeſſion of the glorious Goſpel, nor ſo exactly as they ought by the line of the word of truth in their mouth: Now, the men of this world drawing the line of their judgement from a wrong point, they think thoſe mens Principles nought, and hypocrittically rotten, the word of truth in their mouth an errour, a deluſion, a lye, not remembring the beſt of men muſt have their graines of allowance: Here, they take offence, ſtumble, and fall, riſing up with their backs towards the truth: This God permits in judgement and wrath to the world, that they may ſtumble, and fall, and periſh.\n\n3 The manner of delivering the word of truth in this day of wrath, is a great ſtumbling-block to the world: God ſpeaks to them in wrath, he was wont to ſpeak in love, the Goſpel was glad Tidings; but now the word, is a word of wrath, threatning judgement and deſtruction to the world for their wicked Apoſtacies and rebellions againſt the Lord and his anointed; O ſay they, this is no Goſpel ſpirit, but a ſpirit ofdeluſion; although, it's but the ſame Dialect the Holy Ghoſt uſeth throughout the Revelation againſt ſpiritual Babylon (Antichriſt:) At this they ſtumble, and caſt the word of life far from them, thinking they have good ground ſo to doe.\n4 The Apoſtacy of falſe Brethren from the truth; this is a great ſtumbling-block to the world, by this the world blindly judgeth, that the way of the truth is but a meer phanſie, and hath not that real good in it the world hath, otherwiſe theſe men would not change their ſtation, they cannot think they would take worſe for better, thus they ſtumble, and fall, and periſh: This is alſo the judgement of God upon the world.\n5 The ſpirituality of the truth; At this alſo the men of the world ſtumble, being blind and not apprehending the truth aright, put ſtrange gloſſes upon it, and draw unworthy and uncouth concluſions from it, repreſenting it (Satan helping them) to themſelves and others in a monſtrous ſhape, at which they ſtumble, and fall, and periſh: As thoſe men did, John 6. when Chriſt had been treating of that great and ſpiritual Myſtery, of union with him, it is ſaid, ver. 66. From that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.\n\n\n\nAnd vex them (or trouble them, as it is in the margent) in his ſore diſpleaſure. When God ſpeaks in wrath, ſurely it cannot but bring great trouble to men: When God ſpake in wrath to Saul, that he had rejected him, and given the Kingdome to a neighbour of his better then he, how did it vex and trouble his ſoule? What feare ceized on him? How did it torment him, when he perceived the Lord being departed from him was with David? Oh, ſaith he to his Son, Thou Son of a perverſe woman, doe I not know thou haſt choſen the Son of Jeſſe to thine owne confuſion, for as long as the Son of Jeſſe liveth upon the ground, thou ſhalt not be eſtabliſhed, nor thy Kingdome. How was that moſt excellent King Solomon troubled, when God ſpake in wrath, that he had given the greateſt part of his Kingdome to another? And what trouble and vexation of ſpirit did it bring to all the Kings of Judah, and Iſrael, when at any time God ſpake unto them in his wrath, concerning the matters of their Kingdome? The whole Hiſtory of the Kings make it evident.\n\nAnd vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure. That muſt needs be a dreadfull and terrible trouble, great anxiety of ſpirit, that comes from the ſore diſpleaſure of the great God: If we can imagine any trouble and vexation to be greater and more deadly then another, that muſt needsbe it: Vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure; O dreadfull! what horrors! what gaſtly terrours of death, will encompaſſe men about in that day? If they turne to the left hand; to their Ciſternes they have hewne out to themſelves, behold, they are broken, and hold no water; If to the props they thought to have upheld themſelves with, behold, they are rotten, and will not bear them up; and if to the arm of fleſh, the ſtrength of Aegypt, they truſted to, behold, it's a broken reed, and pierceth their hands: If to the right hand, from whence they are fallen; behold, nothing but the frowning brow of a wrathfull God, and the fiery ſpirit of an enraged people; whoſe heart burneth with the zeale of God, for the honour and glory of their God: What killing diſappointments are here? What no hope? Alas, alas, very little, or none at all: What is the (feared) fruit this brings forth? Why, they repent not, but blaſpheme the God of Heaven.\n               Queſt. But what is this that God ſpeaks to them that thus troubles them?\n\n\nAnſw. The Anſwer you will find in the Text, Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion; It's the word of the Kingdome; that God will take their Crownes from off their heads, and ſet them on the head of Chriſt: How was Herod troubled, and all Jeruſalem with him, when he heard but a where is he that is borne King of the Jewes? How greatly did the tidings of a rightfull King trouble him? His conſcience flyes in his face, and ſtings him, his jealouſie and feare of looſing what he had ſurreptitiouſly gotten, rent his heart with a thouſand anxieties, which vented themſelves in unheard of cruelties againſt poore Innocents: And the Stories of the Martyrs tell us, that ſome Emperors after the example of Herod, have been ſo troubled with the fear of, (and jealous of) King Jeſus his robbing them of their Thrones, they have ſought the deſtruction of the whole lineage of David: And at this day, what a dreadfull troubleſome ſtory is it to the Kings and Rulers of the earth, to heare the doctrine of the Kingdome of Chriſt is aſſerted and preached to the people? How jealous and full of wrath are they! How doth it trouble them!\nQueſt. Why ſhould men be troubled and vexed at this word?\n\n\nAnſw. Truly there's ſome reaſon why the men of the world ſhould be troubled.\n\n1 Becauſe the word is ſpoken, as that which God hath already done; I HAVE ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion: I have done it, ſaith God, and the ſubſequent is eaſily drawne; you muſt ſubmit to him, oryou periſh: If the doctrine were this, That Chriſt ſhould have a Kingdome many hundred yeares to come, the people of God might preach it while their lungs laſted, and meet with no oppoſition from the men of the world, let them alone till that day, think they; but when the word comes ſo neere them, as to ſay, now is the time, God hath already done it, the time of performance is come; This galls them, rubs on the ſore too hard, and troubles them.\n2 Becauſe this Doctrine is preacht in oppoſition to them: YET have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion: YET, though you have taken counſell againſt the Lord and his anointed, to break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords; to keep them at a low and under rate, as Pharoah did, that they may be your ſubjects and ſervants, and never be able to become your Lords: Yet ſaith God, I will ſpeak to you in wrath, and trouble you with this, I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion: I will doe it, you ſhall know and find that I am above you in that wherein you are ſo ſubtilly wiſe; in ſpite of you he ſhall be King, and raigne, it's his right, and he ſhall have it; I have promiſed him, and I will give the Kingdome to him, maugre all your envy and malice; I would not ſuffer the Heathen to keep the Kingdome from him; and have brought downe to the duſt thoſe Kings of the earth you have ſlaine, for their attempts againſt him; and ſhall you proſper in your Apoſtacies and rebellions againſt him? I would not bear with their ſuperſtition, and ſhall I now connive at your hypocriſies? Shall I ſuffer and permit you to keep the Kingdome from him, and to interrupt the performance of my Promiſes? No: know, I ſpeak it to you in my wrath, Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion.\n\n3 Becauſe it will deſtroy all their Idols, deprive them of all their dear enjoyments; their powers, with their pomp and glory, to which their heart cleaves ſo cloſe, this ſword of Chriſts mouth will ſmite them all; their Idols of gold, and their Idols of ſilver, and their Idols of honour, &c. all theſe will it conſume: And their Kingdomes muſt become the Kg domes of the Lords Chriſt, and all their Dominion, and the greatneſſe (the glory of it) ſhall be given to the Saints of the moſt high, thoſe whom they have trampled upon, and to whom they have been ſo barbarouſly ungratefull: Theſe things trouble and vex theſe Rulers, that they gnaw their tongues for anguiſh and paine.\n\nAnd ſurely this is a day of great wrath indeed; as when two Kings, and both ſtrong, are ſtriving for a Crowne, it's likely to be a day ofgreat wrath, a bloody day: So, this day, for behold, what a feaſt will God make on this day, For the Fowles that flye in the midſt of heaven, the fleſh of Kings, the fleſh of Captaines and mighty men, the fleſh of Horſes, and of them that ſit on them, the fleſh of all men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great.\n\n\nWe may conclude from theſe things:\n\n1 It's not unſuitable to a Goſpel ſpirit, to denounce the wrath of God againſt Rulers, for their Apoſtacies and abhominable hypocriſies; yea, and to deale particularly with them, laying the finger on the ſore, pointing out the Abominations by name, denouncing the vengeance of God upon them: For, we ſee here how particularly God characteriſeth theſe Rulers, laying open all their abominations, ſpeaking to them in wrath: And ſurely this alſo (as the reſt of the Scripture) is written for our inſtruction.\n2 It's no wonder that the Rulers of the world are troubled at, and moved againſt the Goſpel of the Kingdome, for here God ſaith, He will ſpeak it to them in wrath, and vex them with it in his ſore diſpleaſure.\n\n3 It's not ſo much the infirmities of the Saints accompanying the delivery of their meſſage to the world, or any other circumſtance about it, that troubles and vexes the Rulers, (let them pretend what they will) as the doctrine it ſelfe, when it's rightly aſſerted, and thorowly opened, as that which is at hand, and ought to be ſubmitted to without delay. O! how doth it trouble and vex them to heare of the coming of King Jeſus, to depoſe them (of their uſurpations) and take the Kingdome to himſelfe? If it troubled Herod, and all Jeruſalem with him, when they heard of this Kings firſt coming meek and lowly; how then think we, will it not much more trouble the Kings and Rulers of the earth to hear of his ſecond coming in power, and the glory of his Sion? It cannot be otherwiſe, for God ſaith he will trouble and vex them with an, I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion.\n\n4 When the Rulers come to this height of ungratefull wickedneſſe, to take counſell againſt the Lord and his anointed, to break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from them, THEN is the time of Gdos wrath come to that Generation; he will ſpeake to them in wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure.\n\n5 That before ſuch time as God enters into judgement with the reſt of the Kings of the earth, and that Whore (myſtery Babylon the great) whom they uphold, God Judges theſe Rulers; he ſpeaks to them inwrath, to them in particular, to them that Take counſell againſt the Lord and his anointed.\n\n\nFor the Lord ſhall riſe up as in mount Perazim, he ſhall be wroth as in the Valley of Gibeon, that he may doe his worke, his ſtrange worke; and bring to paſſe his act, his ſtrange act: Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arme of the Lord, awake as in the ancient dayes, in the Generations of old.\n\n\n2 Here's the work of Gods love and faithfulneſſe to his Son, in theſe words, Yet have I ſet my King upon Sion the hill of my holineſſe: as it is in the margent of the Bible. YET have I, &c. As if God had ſaid, Notwithſtanding your taking counſell againſt him and his anointed, and that you have ſo far proceeded (managing your buſineſſe ſo wiſely, to the very heighth and depth of wiſedome) as to make your ſelves formidable in your owne eyes, thinking you have gotten ſtrength and power ſufficient to put your counſels in practice, crying, Let us breake their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us; yet have I ſet my King upon Sion, the hill of my holineſſe: Though you take counſell againſt him, to make the way to his Kingdome as thorny, difficult, and perillous as you can; though you be ſo ungratefull, and unfaithfull to forſake and take counſell againſt him and his, yet will not I be ſo to my beloved Son, YET have I ſet my King upon Sion the hill of my holineſſe.\n\n\nYet have I ſet MY KING: Though theſe Rulers will not make him a King, yet God will; My King, though they reject him, would breake his bands, and caſt away his cords, that he might not raigne over them, yet God hath made him a King, and given him a Kingdome: He it is, who muſt goe forth conquering and to conquer, deſtroying all his enemies, breaking them to pieces like a Potters veſſel; plucking up every plant that his father hath not planted, throwing downe all thoſe ſuperſtructures that are not of his owne building, creating new Heavens and a new Earth, A New Creation, making it a ſuitable purchaſe to the unvaluable price of his blood, clothing it with his glory, that it may be a fit preſent for his father at the appointed time.\n\nYet have I ſet my King upon SION; That is, the Church of Chriſt, by Sion is meant the Church throughout the whole Scripture; that I ſuppoſe is granted by all, therefore I need not enlarge upon it.\n\nYet have I ſet my King upon Sion the HILL of my holineſſe. Why a hill? A hill is a place of great advantage, on which, if an Army be encamped,it may be an impoſſible thing for the enemy to diſlodge them: So, God here ſets his King upon his Hill (his Church) a place of ſuch advantage, that God doth (if I may ſo expreſſe it) even vaunt it over theſe Rulers, that he hath (notwithſtanding their oppoſitions, policies, ſtratagems, and wiſedome) ſet his King upon his hill, where he is a naile faſtened in a ſure place, on which all the veſſels may hang ſecure and ſafe; ſuch a place, as his being fixt there, fruſtrates all their deſignes, undoes all their contrivements, and brings to naught all their Counſells; it implies ſo much to me, for, it is as if God had ſaid, notwithſtanding you have ſteered a contrary courſe, and taken counſell how to make your ſelves ſtrong, to break my Sons bands and cords, and have prevailed very far, that you are even ready to put your counſells in execution, crying out amaine for action, LET ƲS; notwithſtanding all this, Yet have I ſet my King upon Sion the hill of my holineſſe: I have done it, and there he is, and now what can you doe? It's impoſſible for you to diſlodge him, for my hill is ſtrong, Its terrible as an Army with banners: Why a hill? if a man be upon a hill, he may ſee all round about him; ſo here, God ſets his King upon his hill, that he may from thence take a view of all the motions and contrivements, plots and deſignes of his enemies. When the Son is ſeated on this hill, thoſe Counſels againſt him and his, which were ſecret and hidden, in the dark before, (onely the Eagles of the Age, a penetrating eye, could perceive them) are now made manifeſt, and laid open to the view of all, to the ſhame and confuſion of theſe Rulers.\nAgaine, when a man is ſet on a hill, he may be ſeen and heard of all, as Jotham was by the men of Shechem: So here, God hath ſet his King upon his hill, that his glory may be perſpicuous to the whole world, and the publication of his Decrees may be heard farre and neare, that, though when the voyce of the Trumpet ſounds ſhrill, and waxes louder and louder, the people may tremble for fear, yet, the Moſes's and Joſhuah's may have mountaine diſcoveries of the glory of God, having fellowſhip with the father and the Son, as with a familiar friend.\n\nThe hill of my HOLINESSE: The Kings ſeat is a hill of holineſſe, yea, the hill of Gods holineſſe: But why a hill of holineſſe? why, nothing leſſe then holineſſe is a fit qualification for the ſeat of Chriſt; It's not the great names of men, Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Seekers, Non-church-men, above Ordinances; or Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of Univerſities, Deanes, Maſters and Fellowes of Colledges, Tryers, Parſons and Vicars of Pariſhes, that qualifie menfor the work of Chriſt in this day; no, 'tis onely true holineſſe, the holineſſe (the Image) of God, that onely makes a man a fit ſeat for Chriſt to raigne in, and of which ſoever of the firſt ſort of names of men, they are that have this qualification [holineſſe] they are as ſo many ſands or pieces of this hill of holineſſe, and out of all theſe God will draw his holy ones, and they ſhall become the hill of his holineſſe, and he will ſet his Son there, and he ſhall be their glorious King. The holineſſe of this hill is the ſtrength of it, were it not a holy hill, it might be overcome by the aſſaults and underminings of the enemy. It was the Image of God (which holineſſe is) on Adam in the ſtate of Innocency, that made him a rightfull King over the world, and ſtruck ſuch an awe and dread of him into all the Creatures, keeping them under his obedience, but when he loſt that, he loſt all; ſo, it's the holineſſe of the Church of Chriſt, this ſeat of the King, that makes it an Impregnable Fort againſt her Kings Enemies.\n               And why MY HOLINESSE, the holineſſe of God? All other holineſſe is nothing, mans righteouſneſſe is but droſſe and dung, baſe mettall; but that which is Gods holineſſe, the holineſſe of God imputed to us through Chriſt, the Image of that Imprinted on us by the mighty working of the ſpirit of Chriſt, is that which the gates of hell ſhall not, nor cannot prevaile againſt.\nAnd MY HOLINESSE; the holineſſe of God is a perfect holineſſe, and be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. It's not to be holy in part, but to be wholly holy, all over ſanctified; to be holy, ſo, as to be ſet againſt every wickedneſſe, to allow of, or wink at none: It's neceſſary this hill ſhould be cloathed with the perfect holineſſe of God, otherwiſe it would be as tender towards the wickedneſſes of men, as moſt profeſſors are at this day, and ſo, not be wholly ſet againſt all wickedneſſes, let them be in what men ſoever, Rulers or people (though cover'd over with never ſo curious a covering) Chriſt their King is, and they muſt be ſo, otherwiſe they are no ſeat for him; I have ſet my King on the hill of my holineſſe.\n\n\nI have SET my King, &c. Set him, in a poſture becoming a King; ſet him, as in a ſeat of Judicature, there ſhall he ſit and judge his enemies; out of this hill the Angels come to poure out the Vials of the wrath of God upon the world: Set him, as in Majeſty and glory, above the Kings and Rulers of the earth, that have ſet themſelves, and taken counſell againſt him and his anointed; here he ſhall ſit and behold the wonderfull things the love of the father will doe for his glory and honour.\n\nAnd I have ſet my King; it's God that ſets Chriſt on Syon; I have done it, ſaith God; you thought (and took counſell) to deale wiſely againſt my Son, but I have dealt more wiſely for him, then you could againſt him; you ſeek to hide your counſells from me, and my counſell is hid from yon; you goe in contrary wayes to me, and I ſteer a courſe beyond and contrary to your expectations, and before you are aware bring my purpoſes to paſſe upon you, I have ſet my King on Sion. God doth this for his Son, in ſome eminent way, whereby it appears he doth it, and none elſe; that his Son is engaged to him for his exaltation: There's ſome remarkable unwonted circumſtance accompanies this action, making it eminently evident, to be the work of the finger of God onely; that it's not man, but God himſelfe hath done this; I have done it, ſaith God. Upon this, this hill of God is ſo conſolidated and ſtrengthened, as that Chriſt from hence declares the Decree; hence, the Trumpet ſounds, and all that will not hearken to the voyce thereof, are in great danger of periſhing.\nWe ſee here what God doth for his beloved, in the midſt of the oppoſitions and contradictions of men, He ſets him upon Sion the hill of his holineſſe.\n\n\n\nLet us hence Obſerve.\n1 In this day of his wrath, God will give the Kingdomes to his Son, Yet have I ſet my King upon Sion the hill of my holineſſe; the Rulers taking counſell, and digging deep to hide it from the Lord, caſting about to find out a way to keep his King from his right, in the midſt of his wrath and fury againſt them for their wickedneſſe, he ſets his King on Sion; now, I have done it, ſaith God; he ſpeaks it to them in his wrath, and vexes them (with the doing of it) in his ſore diſpleaſure. God having overturned the Heathen Emperors, the Popiſh Kings of the earth ſnatch up the Crowne, and ſet it on their head; God overturnes ſome of them, and theſe Apoſtate Rulers faſten the Crowne to their Temples; but their comes a third overturning, which is a thorough one indeed, for ſaith God, Remove the Diadem, take off the Crowne, this ſhall not be the ſame, exalt him that is low, and abaſe him that is high: I will overturne overturne overturne it, and it ſhall be no more, untill he come whoſe right it is, and I will give it him: Where are theſe Rulers now? there's no hope for them, for his Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome.\n2 That while theſe Apoſtate Rulers are taking counſell together againſt the Lord and his anointed, the deſigne of God is then, at thattime, to ſet his King upon Sion, the hill of his holineſſe: And he doth it in oppoſition to them, though they contradict it, YET I have done it, ſaith God.\n               3 That the firſt thing God doth for his Son, after he hath made bare his arme, and entred into judgement with the Antichriſtian world (for ſurely he began that work, when theſe Rulers cut downe ſome of the Kings of the earth) and in oppoſition to theſe Rulers, is, to make him King in Sion, in his Church, Yet have I ſet my King ƲPON SION the hill of my holineſſe; He is ſet there, in a poſture fit for the carrying on the deſigne which he and his father are now managing in the world; there is his Throne, and his holy ones about him; and there he will ſit, and together with them judge the world, and poure downe his fathers wrath upon it.\n4 That Sion may be a fit ſeat for the Son to ſettle himſelfe upon, in oppoſition to all his enemies, God makes Sion the hill of his holineſſe; The HILL of my holineſſe; a hill, for ſtrength and ſtability, it's unmoveable; a hill, for union, all its parts are ſo united and compact together, as none can divide it; a hill, for height, The mountaine of the height of Iſrael, it's above the world, reaches up to the Heavens: And a hill of holineſſe; the King being ſeated upon this hill, this metaphoricall hill becomes his Court, and thoſe in it his Courtiers; they are clothed with the ſame clothing his Majeſty is, (h\n•\nlin\n•\nſſe) they are all like their Lord; each one of them reſembling the Children of a King, holineſſe to the Lord is written upon them: And a hill of holines, for they are conſecrated, ſeparated, and ſet apart for the work of Chriſt at this day, ſanctified for this ſervice; enabled to overcome all the aſſaults of the evill one, and having done all to ſtand, to keep their place and ſtation, a ſeat and Throne for Chriſt, to be ſuch Carpenters as ſhall fray away all the Hornes; the ſpirit of the Hornes ſhall not enter into theſe Carpenters, for God ſaith, Sion is the hill of his holineſſe.\n5 Although at this day, many may fall away, and looſe their firſt love, many prove fooliſh Virgins, yet God hath his true Church, his hill of true holineſſe, a fit ſeat for his Son; his choſen number, which he unites together, and by the mighty working of his ſpirit, they become the hill of his holineſſe: He ſets his Son upon this hill, and thence he iſſues forth the Decrees of his father about the concernments of his Kingdome, notwithſtanding the power and forces of his enemies againſt him.\n6 That under the Government of theſe Rulers the people of Godhave not liberty to come up to the height of Gods holineſſe, for when they come to be a hill of holineſſe, the world ſtands in oppoſition to them, and they unto the world. Chriſt is ſet upon the hill of Gods holineſſe, in oppoſition to the Rulers of the world: If any then blame the followers of the Lamb, as buſie-bodies and raſh ſpirits, ſaying it's otherwiſe with them now, then it was under the Kings, they may be as holy as they will, and live in their fellowſhip with God and Chriſt in his owne Ordinances to the higheſt; it's a falſity, for if they ſeek after the height of Gods holineſſe, (to get to the top of this hill) to enjoy the fullneſſe of the Promiſes in Chriſt, by following him fully according to the voyce of his ſpirit in his word in this day, they are oppoſed by the Rulers, and taken counſell againſt.\n               7 We may here ſee what God expects from his Sion (his Church) that in this day, when the Rulers and great men of the world reject Chriſt, and take counſell againſt him and his, that this his hill of holineſſe ſhould receive his Son, and cleave ſo cloſe to him, eſpouſe his righteous intereſt ſo unfeignedly and ſo zealouſly, as that it may be a hill of advantage whereon Chriſt may ſit as King, in oppoſition to the Kings of the earth, and in deſpite of theſe Rulers; although the Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſell together againſt the Lord and his anointed; when the Kings and the Rulers combine together to doe their utmoſt, the one by an open perverſe ſetting themſelves, the other by taking counſell (pernicious ſecret counſell) againſt him and his, and at laſt ſhall conjoyne Forces, openly ſetting themſelves to act their counſells; things at this paſſe, God brings his Son to Sion, his Church, the hill of his holineſſe, he is totally excluded the world, by the men of the world, from having any ſhare in their Royalties, in theſe Rulers the father hath tryed the fineſt and pureſt piece of earth the world can ſhew, and finding it falſe, he brings his Son to Sion, ſets him there, as in a ſafe place, expecting they will ſubmit their necks to his yoke, and their ſhoulders to his burden, and follow him in his goings forth againſt his enemies, after what manner ſoever they be, whitherſoever he will lead them; This indeed is the ready way to find out an everlaſting reſt, to get a full poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land, to be bleſſed in heavenly places with him.\nLaſtly, Behold, the Lamb with his 144000, his choſen number, ſtanding upon Mount Sion, having their fathers name written in their foreheads. (Sion is the hill of my holineſſe, ſaith God.) Here are the Armies of Heaven, with the great Captaine of Salvation in the head ofthem, in a poſture fit, ready prepared to execute the Decree, Thou ſhalt breake them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell: But before they enter upon this ſtrange and wonderfull work, being the will of their deare Captaine and leader, they ſing as it were a new ſong of praiſe unto God, before the Throne; and though it be a hard ſong that the world cannot learn, and it ſounds harſhly in their eares, ſeeming to them ſuch a thing as never was before, a new invention of the ſpirit of deluſion; yet, theſe choſen holy ones they are acquainted with, and expert in, ſinging this ſong before the Throne of God: Chriſt their Captaine begins, and they follow on, declaring the Decree.\n            \n\nSo that now we are come to the work of Chriſt in this day, to conſider what that is, that the Son goeth about as his work in this day of his Fathers wrath: It is, declaring the Decree of his father, as he tells us in theſe words, I will declare the Decree: He being thus ſeated on Sion, the hill of Gods holineſſe, he preſently without delay ſends abroad his Heralds, layes his claime, and ſhewes his right and title to the world, the Decree of his Father: We may here conſider,\n\n1 The Perſon declaring.\n2 The Declaration it ſelfe.\n3 The Matter of the Declaration.\n4 The Perſons to whom this Declaration is made.\n\n1 The Perſons declaring; I will declare the Decree; This is\n\n1 Chriſt Perſonall, the Mediator \n•\nhriſt Jeſus: That Son of God whom the father hath ſet upon Sion the hill of his holineſſe, he declares the Decree by his ſpirit in Sion among his choſen ones.\n2 Chriſt Myſticall; This cannot reaſonably be denyed, ſaith Chriſt, A body haſt thou prepared me, then ſaid I, loe I come to doe thy will O God. Intimating, that it was of neceſſity Chriſt ſhould have a body before he could come to doe the will of his father; It's by this body of his as the inſtrument in his hand, that he fullfills the will of God; ſo, it's by his myſticall body (his Church) that he declares the Decree; doth this his work in this day of his Regement in Sion: Further, it's ſaid, The Law ſhall goe forth out of Sion. And againe, Mat. 10.27. What I tell you in darkneſſe, that ſpeake ye in the light; and what ye hear in the eare, that Preach ye upon the houſe top. Here's the man Chriſt Jeſus teaching his Sion, and a command to them to declare it publickly to the world; This is that ſharp ſword going out of his mouth wherewith he ſmites the Nations.\n2 The declaration it ſelfe; I will DECLARE the Decree: Declare it, how? why, as a Herald declares the Decree of a Prince or State, with ſound of Trumpet, and a loud voyce, in places of greateſt note and reſort, in the moſt open and publick manner that can be, that all may hear, that the Decree may come the eare of every man: So here, I will declare the Decree, ſo publickly, upon the houſe top, on the Mount, the Trumpet ſhall ſound ſo ſhrill and loud, that it ſhall pierce the eares of all, yea, of the Kings and Judges of the earth; for, the exhortation to repentance is grounded upon this Declaration, Be wiſe now therefore, &c. which could not be a motive to them to repent, except they heard it; And I will declare the Decree, lay it all open, make it fully knowne, ſpread it before the underſtandings of men, that none may through ignorance periſh from the way, and looſe that bleſſedneſſe I have in my hand to give unto all them that put their truſt in me.\n3 The matter of the Decree; in which we have theſe ſix particulars.\n\n1 The party decreeing.\n2 The Decree it ſelfe.\n3 The means by which the performance is obtained.\n4 The account or ſcore upon which the father doth all this for his Son.\n5 The perſon to whom this gift is given.\n6 The time when God will beſtow this gift.\n\n\n\n1 It's the Lord Jehovah that makes this Decree: who then can alter, or diſanull it? Shall the Lawes of the Medes and Perſians be unalterable, and ſhall not the Decrees of the great God of Heaven and earth? What folly is it for the world to oppoſe it? What fools-hardineſſe is it for men to fight againſt the Almighty God?\n2 Here's the Decree it ſelfe: And therein\n\nFirſt, A Donation, or Gift: I will GIVE thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion; It's a Royall gift indeed, fit for a King to receive, and for the glorious God and father of our Lord to beſtow; no leſſe then a whole world; Heathens for an Inheritance, and utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion: O matchleſſe love of a father to a beloved Son! The Heathens that knew him not ſhall become his Inheritance, he will call upon the Nation that hath not been called by his name to behold him; he will be ſought of them that asked not for him, and be found of them that ſought him not; and the utmoſt parts of the earth ſhall be a habitation forhim, to have and to hold, as the good pleaſure of his father: all things ſhall be put under his feet; There ſhall be given him Dominion, and glory, and a Kingdome, that all people, Nations, and languages ſhall ſerve him: And that this gift might be certaine and ſure, that nothing may be able to interrupt his poſſeſſing it, we have in the\nSecond place, The means decreed and appointed, whereby he ſhall take this inheritance and poſſeſſion to himſelfe: Thou ſhalt break them with A ROD OF IRON, and daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell: Breake them, take their power, rule, and Dominion away, breake their Scepters, and throw downe their Corwnes.\n\n\nBreake THEM: who? why, all that in enmity oppoſe him, the raging Heathen, the profane Kings of the earth, and all the Hypocriticall Saint-like Rulers, that would not have him to raigne over them; them ſhall he break: THOƲ ſhalt breake them; Chriſt, the Lamb on Mount Sion, he ſhall doe it, with his followers, that follow him whitherſoever he goeth: But with what? With A ROD of iron; Here is the materiall ſword, the inſtrument with which Chriſt ſhall break all his enemies; He that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword; they have ſhed the blood of the Saints and Prophets, and he will give them blood to drinke, for they are worthy: Behold, I will make thee a new threſhing Inſtrument, having Teeth: Thou ſhalt threſh the mountaines, and beate them ſmall, and ſhalt make the hills as chaffe: And daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell; He ſhall break them all to ſhivers, grind them to powder, and make them become as the mire in the ſtreets, and the chaffe of the ſummers threſhing-floore, that the wind ſhall carry them away, and no place ſhall be found for them any more: And he ſhall doe this with as great facillity and eaſe, as a man daſheth a Potters veſſell to pieces; he ſhall have no more trouble in it, then a man hath in daſhing a brittle earthen pot to pieces againſt the ground.\n3 The means by which the Son obtaines the performance of this Decree; his interceſſion; ASKE of me; It's but ask and have, if the Lord ask his father any thing, he will give it him; if he ask a world, his enemies for an Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion, his requeſt is granted; The father heareth him alwayes, he neither will nor can deny him what he deſires. Aske of me the Heathen for thine inheritance, and thou ſhalt have them ſaith God, either thy ſlaves or thy free-men, which thou wilt, they ſhall be thine to doe with them as thou pleaſeſt: Aske of me, the utmoſt parts of the earthfor a poſſeſſion, and thou ſhalt have it; if thou wilt have a whole world for thy Court, to entertaine thy followers, thy choſen ones, it's thine: And that the world may be emptied of all thoſe uſurpers, enemies of thine in it, that thou mayeſt take quiet poſſeſſion, Ask of me, and thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, and daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell, ſend them flying into another world to inherit their merited portion with hypocrites and unbelievers: And ASKE of me, and I will give thee, &c. If thou wilt have the gift of my love, thou muſt ask it, ASKE of me; I will give nothing without asking, therefore come, Aske of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion.\n\n4 Upon what account or ſcore is it that the father will doe ſo much for this his Son? Why, it's ſolely upon the account of his Son-ſhip; Thou art my SON, this day have I begotten thee; therefore now, Ask of me, and I will give thee, &c. God will give this gift to none but his Son, and were he not his Son he ſhould not have it; it's a gift too rich and too glorious for any beſides the Son of God, the Heire of the Promiſes: Thou art my SON, ſaid God, and I am engaged as I am thy father, to beſtow a fatherly gift upon thee, and now Aske of me, and I will beſtow ſuch a gift upon thee, as becomes my glory to give, and thine honour to receive; Thou art my SON, this day have I BEGOTTEN thee, I conceive this is not onely meant of the eternall generation of the Son, nor onely of that day of Chriſts exaltation and honour, when the father raiſed him from the dead, not ſuffering his holy one to ſee corruption, making it evident he was the eternall Son of God, a perfect and all-ſufficient Mediator; but alſo of this day, wherein God exalteth him as King, and makes him King in Sion: THIS DAY have I begotten thee, that is, this day have I made it evident to the whole world thou art my Son; I have but now begotten thee as to them, they would not believe before that thou waſt my Son, ſuch a Son, as I have made Heir and King of the world; but now, I have ſet thee on Sion, and it being out of all diſpute in Sion, that thou art the onely rightfull King (and that I have made thee ſo) they have received thee, thou art ſet as a King there; and there is a ſufficient light held out to the world from thence, of the truth of this, to leave them without excuſe if they ſubmit not to thee; ſo that, as I have begotten thee before times was, now I have begotten thee in this day alſo; and being thou art my begotten Son, mine honour is concerned in thine honour, Aske of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thy inheritance, andthe utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.\n\n5 To whom is this gift given? To the Son as Mediator, for we ſee it's the fruit of his Interceſſion, ASKE of me: And if ſo, then, to him as a repreſentative, a common perſon, and ſo to all thoſe he repreſents; if it be given to him, then to his alſo, for Of his fullneſſe we receive grace for grace.\n\n6 What day, or time is this, wherein God puts on his Son to make ſuch requeſts, and promiſes to doe ſuch great things for him? Why, THIS DAY, wherein God notwithſtanding all the oppoſition of the world, and worldly powers (and in particular theſe Rulers) and in wrath to them for it, ſhall ſet his King upon Sion, the hill of his holineſſe; this day, wherein I have begotten thee; ask of me this day; and I will this day give thee, the Heathen for thy Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion: And this day thou ſhalt break them with a rod of Iron, and daſh them to pieces like a Potters veſſell: even this day, wherein thou ſhalt ask it of me.\n4 Let us conſider the Perſons to whom this Decree is declared, they are, The Kings and Judges of the earth: Thoſe very Kings and Rulers (though here called Judges upon a ſignificant account) which ſet themſelves and take counſel together againſt the Lord and his anointed: The Decree is declared and publiſhed to them, as is undeniably evident, by the Exhortation grounded upon the Decree, Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth; You oppoſe me, ſetting your ſelves, and taking counſell againſt me, but you now heare the unalterable Decree of the great Jehovah my father, Be wiſe now therefore.\n\n\n\nFrom theſe things we may conclude,\n\n1 At this day, when Chriſt is ſeated on Sion the Hill of Gods Holineſſe, there begins a new quarrell between Chriſt and the worlds Rule\n•\ns: He layes his claime to the world, which they ſay is their Dominion, and that he hath nothing to doe with it, but with his Church, bidding him keep to his Sion, where his God and father hath ſet him, and meddle not with them, for that is out of his ſphere: And out of Sion Chriſt declares the Decree, his right and title to the utmoſt parts of the earth, and, that his father hath given him the Sword of his mouth, and a rod of iron, to ſmite and break all that oppoſe him, taking poſſeſſion of his fathers Donation; This breeds ſuch jealouſie, wrath, and fury between theſe two Competitors, that never was ſuch a quarrelling day ſince the world had a being; Now the conteſt is between Chriſtand man, not ſuch (as God hath made uſe of formerly to bring to paſſe his purpoſes) as are between man and man, but it's between Chriſt (who is God) and man, which of theſe ſhall have the Rule and Government: Formerly, the world hath had it's coverings, to hide and garniſh over its actions, that they have not appeared in their true colours, and God ſuffered it ſo to be, but now the mask is taken off, they appeare plainly what they are, againſt Chriſt (notwithſtanding all ſpetious pretences whatſoever) to the view of all the world: And as Chriſt deales more roundly with them, ſo will they be more outragious and inveterate againſt him, leaving no place for repentance: I will declare the Decree, ſaith Chriſt, and You Kings and Judges of the earth, repent and kiſſe the Son, or you periſh; This not ſuiting with the high ſpirits of the world, they will yet kick againſt the pricks, perſiſt in their old practice, in perſecution of, and oppoſition againſt the Lord of life and glory.\n2 That it's the Duty (and ſo no ſin, nor contrary to Goſpel Principles and Rules) of the anointed of the Lord, thoſe Herralds of his glory that he ſends into the world, (it's the very will of the Father, and of the Son) they ſhould Preach and declare this Decree concerning the Kingdome of the Son fully, according to the due import of A Declaration, in the eares of the whole world, yea, that the Kings and Judges of the earth may heare, and feare, and tremble: If men or Devils in men beſmear them with the ſpurious conceptions of their owne filthy hearts, what matters it? They have the pure water of the word at hand to waſh off all that dirt: It's the work of Chriſt in this day of his fathers love, (I will declare the Decree) that which he will doe by his body, his Myſticall Members, and men cannot duely nor rightly charge his holy ones with ſin or folly, in this their obedience to their Lord: It's the work of Chriſt, to declare it in Sion by his ſpirit, and it's the work of Sion (as the Inſtrument in his hand) to declare it againe to the world, in oppoſition to the Kings and Rulers thereof, in their uſurpations upon the Royall intereſt and Prerogative of Jeſus King of Sion.\n\n3 That this Declaration is publiſhed in the time of the fathers wrath, neither is this expreſſion of the Sons love without ſome tokens of diſpleaſure: The world and the powers thereof, have ſo ſlighted, trampled upon, and provoked the Son, as he will not ſpeak one word for them to plead their cauſe with his father; but by his ſilence ſuffers his fathers wrath to break forth, ſpeaking to them in wrath, and vexing them inhis ſore diſpleaſure. The father having by his Almighty power ſet his King on Sion, and he being ready to over-run the world with the execution of his fathers juſt diſpleaſure, his heart being tender, his bowels rowle within him towards poore ſinners, he muſt declare the Decree, with an Exhortation if now at laſt they will come in, ſubmit to him, and he will bleſſe them; yet it's very haſty, and ends with the harſh ſound of a threating, in caſe of a non-ſudden-acceptance, there's a tang of the fathers wrath, and the Sons provoked diſpleaſure goes along with it; the cleareſt ſun-ſhine of this day is clouded with ſymptomes and tokens of wrath and diſpleaſure, then it's no wonder if God judicially throw ſtumbling-blocks in the way of this Generation in this day, that they may not hearken to the voyce of his Son, but ſtumble, and fall, and periſh.\n4 The father having decreed to give the whole world to his Son, Heathens for an inheritance, and utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion; it muſt of neceſſity be, that all the GREAT poſſeſſors of this earthen world, will prove his enemies; and the declaration of this Decree, will ſet the world on fire, fill it with a fiery fury: The heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noyſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, the earth alſo and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.\n\n5 That this is no rebellious nor ſtrange word, but a doctrine becoming the Goſpel and Goſpel times, to proclaime the War of the Lord againſt all the enemies of Chriſt; it's the mind of the father, for this is part of the Decree which the Son hath engaged to declare, Thou ſhalt breake them with a rod of iron, and daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell.\n\n6 That this day, is a day of great ſupplication and prayer, ASKE of me, ſaith God, the father commands to aske, upon ſuch an encouraging account, as that it provokes Chriſt and his followers to lye hard at the Throne of grace, for the performance of the fathers Promiſes, ſaith God, ASKE and I will give; ASKE, or you cannot receive; but ASKE and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion: If God command to aske, upon ſuch an account, how can it be but his people will obey with rejoycing, filling the Heavens with their cryes? And can we think Chriſt will not fill the Cenſor with theſe odours, and offer them up upon the Altar as a ſweet perfume to God his father, and then, what voyces! what thunderings! lightnings! and Earth-quakes will this firefrom the Altar fill the earth with? Theſe will fill the Vials of Gods wrath, and ſend the Angels out of the Temple to poure them out upon the world.\n7 Here's a direction for prayer, in this day: It's the will of the father, the prayers of the Saints ſhould be chiefly, and in the firſt place, for the glory of Chriſt, that he may have Heathens for an Inheritance, and utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion; And for vengeance, and ability to execute the wrath of God upon the world ſecondarily, meerly as a means to accompliſh the former, by removing lets and hindrances out of the way; Their heart in prayer to their father, ought to run out chiefly for the glory of Chriſt; and ſurely, if the world would be converted and turne to God, it would redound much to the honour of our Lord Jeſus, therefore Chriſt undertakes to declare the Decree, tells them the whole ſum of the matter, with Exhortation to come in to him, that they may be bleſſed with everlaſting happineſſe; but if they will not hearken to this voyce of love, then, ASKE, and thou ſhalt breake them with a rod of iron, and daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell.\n\n8 In this day the Interceſſion of Chriſt, and ſo the prayers of the Saints, will be of very high concernment, of dangerous conſequence to the world and worldly powers; They reach at no leſſe then the Crowns and Scepters of the world, that the whole world may become the Lord Chriſts, Heathens for an Inheritance, and utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion: As the Saints formerly prayed againſt the Heathens rage, and the Kings open profaneneſſe, in ſetting themſelves againſt their Lord; ſo, they now pray as zealouſly againſt the Clandeſtine cunning Counſells of hypocriticall Apoſtate Rulers; what though the men of the world, and ſome deluded ſincere hearts, call it ſin (and groſſe infirmity at the beſt) leading to rebellion, unwarrantable talking tending to nought but ruine, it matters not, they have the command of the great Jehovah for it, ASKE of me (ſaith he) and I will give thee the Heathens; ASKE of me and I will give thee the utmoſt parts of the earth; ASKE of me and thou ſhalt breake them with a rod of iron, and daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell: ASKE theſe things of me, pray for them and I will give them.\n9 That in this day, the perverſe oppoſition of the worlds Saint-like Rulers to the Lord and his anointed, will prove ſuch, as will compell them, to ask of their father AN IRON ROD; ſuch an iron rod, wherewith they may breake their enemies, and daſh them to pieces like apotters veſſell: And if they ask it, he hath promiſed he will give it, and that in their hand it ſhall doe his appointed work; and then woe to the world, for, how great will the Vintage of Gods wrath upon the world be in that day.\n10 Such prayers are no way contrary to the will and mind of God, nor unſuitable to a Goſpel ſpirit in Goſpel times, for we ſee at this day, wherein Chriſt is taking his Kingdome to ſet forth the Goſpel in all its glory, the Command is, ASKE of me; God will be askt for ſuch things, the giving of which ruines this old world, and makes way for the new Heavens and new Earth: ASKE of me, the Heathens for an inheritance, the Powers, Crownes, Scepters of the great men of the world, and I will give them to thee; ASKE of me the utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion, the whole habitable earth for a place to diſplay thy glory in, and I will give it; Pray unto me, againſt the Rulers, their Apoſtacy and wickedneſſes, taking ſecret wylie Counſell, combining in leagues and agreements together, aſoſiating themſelves with the Kings of the earth againſt the Lord and his anointed, and that, to break their bands, and caſt away their cords; Cry aloud unto me againſt them, and theſe their abominable practices, and I will put the iron ſword of my wrath and vengeance into thy hand, and thou ſhalt break them with it, and my ſpirit ſhall ſo aſſiſt thee, by an Almighty operation, as that there ſhall be as great eaſe and facillity without let or hinderance in doing this work of my juſt wrath and vengeance, as there is in daſhing a potters veſſel againſt the ground.\n11 Here is great encouragement to the Saints and people of God to perſiſt and grow valiant in the way of the truth, of this truth; Lift up your hearts, cryes, and groanes higher and higher, to your God and father, againſt the enemies of your Lord, and for the glory and Kingdome of Chriſt; for, while you are ſo doing, you are in your fathers way, doing his Command, ASKE of me, ſaith he. Againe, you are in the way of the Promiſe, if you aske, God hath Promiſed he will give, ASKE of me and I will give thee; yea, God ſtands here in a giving poſture, he waites but for a Petition, and when it comes, he anſwers it gratiouſly, he bids you aske that he may give; there's a neceſſity you muſt aske, ſaith God, I have a gift in my hand worthy a God to beſtow, but you muſt aske it ere I can give it, that is the order I have ſet downe to my ſelfe to walk by, and I cannot, it becomes not my wiſedome to recede from it, therefore ASKE of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thy Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.\n\n12 That there will be in this day, a reluctancy and backwardneſſe in the people of God, to the performance of this great duty this diſpenſation of the father layes upon them; which may come to paſſe partly through the darkneſſe of this day, the uncertainty and unclearneſſe of things, that they know not what to judge of them, (as hath been opened already;) and partly through that little betterneſſe in their condition now to what it was under the Government of the Kings, through carnality of ſpirit being ready to ſit downe there; and partly through unbelief of heart, every little hardſhip and difficulty they phanſie to be in the way, they look upon as impoſſibilities, and the multiplying-glaſſe of unbeliefe, makes them to ſeem ſuch tall and mighty Sons of Anake, as God cannot pull downe and overcome; ſo that they are ready to cry out, Let us make us a Captaine, and returne to our Onyons and Garlicke, and fleſh-pots in Aegypt, for it was better then with us than it is now: If this were not ſo, this Command ASKE of me, were needleſſe, for otherwiſe they would be willing enough and forward enough of themſelves, their owne eternall happineſſe and glory is ſo much concerned in it, that it would be a motive ſtrong enough and ſufficient to draw them; but here God is faine to call upon and command his people, ASKE of me.\n\n13 The time of Gods giving an anſwer and returne to all the prayers of the Saints, is now come: God having filled his hand full of bleſſings, he ſtands ready to open it, and ſcatter them downe upon his people, therefore ſaith he, ASKE and I will give; ASKE of me, that I may give; fill up the meaſure of your prayers, that I may fill up the meaſure of my gifts; I have ſeene, ſaith God, the hard meaſure you have met with from the world for my Sons ſake, how ungratefully and unworthily they have dealt with you, trampling upon you as dung, deriding you as the off-ſcouring and droſſe of mankind; but now, come, ASKE of me, and I will give you the reward of all your labour of love, a Crowne of glory for your Crowne of Thornes, a Royall Exchange indeed: O! how tender hath Chriſt (by preſenting to his open view, the wounds he received, the blood he ſhed, and the ſufferings he underwent) made the heart of his father? He can bear no longer, he cannot ſtay till his people come and aske, but calls upon them, Come my Lambs, ASKE of me, and I will give; ASKE, that I may give you the Heathen for an inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion: He that commands to aske, promiſes to give, this is the time of giving, here's the time of receiving.\n14 The neceſſity, and mighty force and power of the ſpirit of prayer; ſaith God, ASKE of me that I may give; you muſt aske before I give; and ASKE of me, and I cannot deny you, but I muſt give you, Heathens for an inheritance, and utmoſt parts of the earth for a poſſeſſion; ASKE of me, and I muſt help you, and you hall breake your enemies with a rod of iron, and daſh them to pieces like a potters veſſell.\n\n15 What a uſefull inſtrument hath God made Syon to be to his Son; as Sion muſt become the hill of Gods holineſſe before ſhe can be a fit ſeat for Chriſt, ſo before Chriſt can be exalted and honoured as King, he muſt be ſeated on Sion; he muſt be ſeated as a King there before he is in a fit poſture to declare the Decree of his father, his right and title to the world; and as ſoone as he is ſettled there, he is accompliſht at all points, to encounter with the enemies of his Kingdome, ſends them a defiance, a declaration of his right and title to their uſurped poſſeſſions; Sion is his Magazine, out of which he fetches all his inſtruments of war, and which he hath made of ſufficient force to blow up and bring to ruine all the foundations of rebellion and oppoſition his enemies have laid againſt him.\n16 It's worthy our taking notice of, and of confiderable conſequence for us to obſerve, The way of our Lords proceedings in this day, wherein he is harneſſing himſelfe for the battel; it's not the way and courſe of the politick inventions, Machiavillian ſtratagems, under-hand-workings, and by the Maximes of State of this world; but in a noble, plaine, heroick way, like a piece of the trueſt valour that ever drew ſword, like himſelfe, ſends forth his Heralds, commands voluntary ſubmiſſion, or elſe gives the challenge, lets them know, there's no way but death, periſhing from the way of bleſſedneſſe.\n17 That it's the greateſt folly and madneſſe for the Rulers and Judges of the world to oppoſe and fight againſt this praying people; for they are not onely againſt them, but the Father the Son and the ſpirit, and all the Hoſt of Heaven are againſt them: As Eliſha ſaid, They that be with us are more then they that be againſt us, there's a greater and a ſtronger power with them, than the worldly Rulers can raiſe againſt them, although they could bring up Hell it ſelfe from the deep to ſerve them.\n18 What a ſad account will thoſe be able to give, who joyne and ſtrike hands with theſe perverſe Rulers in this day; alſo, thoſe who have not heart nor courage to ſtand up for the Son againſt theſe Rulers,and their wickedneſſes; For whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he ſhall come in his owne glory, and in his fathers, and of the holy Angels. What ſhame and confuſion of face will ceaſe upon them in that day? If ever there was a time, wherein Chriſt expects his friends ſhould ſtand by him, and plead for him, it's now, in this day ſpoken of in the Text, wherein the Rulers take ſuch pernicious counſell againſt him, and thoſe that forſake him now, he will not owne before his father, for we ſee at the latter end of the Pſalme, thoſe that kiſſe not the Son, ſubmit not to him, and come under his yoke, periſh from the way of bleſſedneſſe; they ſhall receive their portion with thoſe that ſhall come at the laſt day, crying, Lord Lord open unto us, and Chriſt ſhall profeſſe he knoweth them not.\n\n\n\nThe third and laſt part of our work, is, To conſider the manner how Chriſt manageth his work in this day, and that is, with much love and pitty to the ſoules of men, exhorting them to a timely repentance, promiſing bleſſedneſſe to all that hearken to him; Although he hath ſeparated his Sion from the world, and made it the Hill of Gods Holineſſe, a fit ſeat for himſelfe; yet, he cannot be contented to goe with a ſword in one hand to execute his fathers Decree, but he muſt have a Pardon in the other, to beſtow upon all thoſe that will ſubmit and come in unto him.\n\nBe wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings: be inſtructed, ye Judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling. Kiſſe the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.\n\nIn theſe words we have\n\n1 An Exhortation.\n\n2 Motives to provoke men to hearken to it.\n\nIn the Exhortation we have\n1 The Perſons exhorted, and they are chiefly the Kings and Judges of the earth; thoſe very Kings that ſet themſelves, and thoſe very Judges (or Rulers) that take counſell together againſt the Lord and his anointed: But though the Exhortation be chiefly to the Kings and Judges, yet not excluſive to others, for we find in the laſt clauſe of the Pſalme, Bleſſedneſſe promiſed to all them that put their truſt in the Son; which ALL takes in more then the Kings and Rulers, yea, ALL men of what rank and condition ſoever that put their truſt in him, ſhall be bleſſed; and it muſt of neceſſity follow, the Exhortation is of aslarge an extent as that ALL, for the Promiſe is brought in as a Motive to provoke to a hearty embracing of, and hearkening to it.\n               2 Here's the matter of the Exhortation: which is,\n1 To get a true and an exact knowledge of God and his wayes, in this their day: Which is held out unto us in two expreſſions, WISEDOME and INSTRƲCTION.\n\n\nBe WISE now therefore O ye Kings: O you prophane Kings, that having a whores forehead and a face of braſſe, without ſhame and remorſe have ſtood up, and ſet your ſelves publickly, wilfully, with all your might againſt-me-without a cauſe, to keep me from my rightfull inheritance, and to prevent my entring my poſſeſſions, the Copy-hold my father hath given me: Be wiſe now THEREFORE; wherefore? why, you have heard the Decree of my father, the Juſtice and Equity of my right and Title to my Kingdome; I have askt it, and he hath given it me, who hath right and power to give it, he that made it hath given it to me: And my father having ſet me on Sion the Hill of his Holineſſe, I am prepared to encounter you, I will waite your leaſure no longer; therefore now be wiſe, know, conſider what you have to doe, if you reſiſt and ſtand it out, there's no way but periſhing and death; but if you ſubmit your ſelves unto, and put your truſt in me, I will bleſſe you, make you really happy; here's life and death ſet before you, be wiſe now in your choyce, that you may live and not dye: Be wiſe with the wiſedome of God wherein is life, for why will ye dye? You are Kings, and it's a hard leſſon for you to be willing to part with your great poſſeſſions, and become Beggars, but learne it, and you ſhall find wiſedome it ſelfe in ſuch ſeeming folly; Whatſoever any man forſakes for my ſake, I will give it him againe in my Kingdome with great advantage, ſaith Chriſt; Be wiſe, know and conſider the great Jehovah my father, and what he hath already done for me; know and conſider me alſo, what I am to doe to, and in the world, as the will of my father in this day of his great wrath and fury.\n\nBe INSTRƲCTED ye Judges of the earth: Ye Judges, you that have ſet your ſelves above the rank, and your feet on the neck of Kings, that would be accounted repairers of the breaches, and reſtorers of the paths to dwell in; and yet take counſell againſt the Lord and his anointed, to break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from you; you Judges, that carry it ſo underhand and ſecretly againſt me and mine, while you ſeem to be for me, pretending a kiſſe, when you intend a blow under the fifth rib, that you need not ſtrike a ſecond time:Come you Judges be INSTRƲCTED, know the wickedneſſe and folly of your malicious wayes, they will yield you nothing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, the beſt fruit they can preſent you with is torment; for, this Proverb ſhall be taken up againſt you, The Lord hath broken the ſtaffe of the wicked, and the Scepter of the Rulers, yea, Tophet is ordained of old, yea, for the King it is prepared, he hath made it deepe and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the wrath of the Lord like a ſtream of brimſtone doth kindle it: ye Judges of the EARTH; though you have ſet your ſelves in the higheſt forme, and will not be numbred among the Kings of the earth, but preſent your ſelves to the world as Rulers, your Authority and Government to be of my fathers appointment, and according to his will; yet, be inſtructed in this, know this, that you and your inventions are of the earth, earthy; though you will not be Kings of the earth, yet you are Judges of the earth, though the moſt refined, yet ſtill but earth; you, your wayes, and inventions, are not of, nor from heaven, but of and from the earth: Be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth in the wiſedome of God, in the ſervice, worſhip, and out-goings of God in this your day, you have been cunning and wiſe Counſellors for your ſelves, and in your own wayes and concernments; be ye now inſtructed, become as wiſe and knowing in the ways and concernments of God and his Son in this your day: Be wiſe ye Kings, and be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth, hearken unto me or you periſh from the way of life and bleſſedneſſe, and goe into eternall death and miſery.\n               2. To worſhip the true God, and him onely▪ Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling; Here's both ſervice done to God, and rejoycing in God; and they are exhorted to mix the one with fear, and to mingle trembling with the other, and then they will be in the way of the Promiſe, Iſa. 66.2. To this man will I looke, even to him that is poore, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my word. And Pſal. 112.1. & 145.191. Mal. 4.2. Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commandements. He will full fill the deſire of them that feare him, he alſo will heare their cry, and will ſave them. But unto you that fear my name, ſhall the Son of righteouſneſſe ariſe, with healing in his wings; and ye ſhall goe forth, and grow up as the Calves of the ſtall.\n\n3 To a hearty ſubmiſſion to the Son in this way the father hath ſet him; giving him that honour and thoſe dues, the father hath decreed he ſhall have; KISSE THE SON; this kiſſe gives us to underſtand,the moſt abſolute ſubjection that is poſſible; not that which is onely of the outward man, through fear and inability to reſiſt, but that, which is from the heart, and the fruit of the ſtrongeſt love, grounded upon the beſt and ſureſt Baſis of the higheſt reaſon.\n               2 The Lord gives the world ſeverall Motives to provoke them to hearken to his advice and Counſell. And they are\n1 The Conſideration of the Sons anger; Kiſſe the Son leaſt he be angry: All the day long hitherto we were exhorted to repentance and ſubmiſſion to the Son, from the conſideration of his love and tenderheartedneſſe to ſinners, but now we are call'd upon with a Leaſt he be angry; The day of Gods judging this Generation, and putting the Decree in execution, the time for the full performance of his Promiſes to his choſen ones, is come, and now Chriſts heart is ſo full of love to his ſuffering ones, that have been ſo long trampled upon by the world, that he is ſo intenſe upon giving out the gifts of his father (their Crowne) to them, that he will not tarry nor waite long, but his anger will be kindled, and then there followes nothing but woe, periſhing, death: And leaſt he be angry, it ſtrongly implies, that he will be angry, and angry to the purpoſe with all thoſe that will not readily and quickly hearken to him, inflicting no leſſe puniſhment upon them than periſhing, eternall death.\n2 The Conſideration of the ſad condition we ſhall be in, if his wrath be kindled but a little: and ye periſh from the way, When his wrath is kindled but a little: Here's a periſhing woe; now his wrath is kindled and kindled but a little, there's no way but death; how dangerous is it to provoke the Son in this day, when a little kindling of his wrath will periſh our ſoules! How ſtrongly ought this to work upon us, to move us to make haſt and meet him in the way, leaſt his wrath be kindled but a little, and he accuſe us to the Judge, not owning us before his father, and our portion be to periſh with the hypocrite and unbeliever:\n\nAnd periſh from the way; another piece of the Motive, and an aggravation of our ſin if we hearken not to it; While this Exhortation ſounds in our eares, we are in the way to happineſſe, the day of Salvation is not quite ſpent and gone, the night hath not yet totally ceazed upon us, but, if our dull and ſtubborne hearts, by not cloſing with his gratious motions, kindle his wrath but a little, we periſh, the day of ſalvation is cut off from us, the night of judgement and wrath ceazes upon us, and we are undone for eternity.\n3 A Promiſe of Bleſſedneſſe; Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him: Here's love indeed! Come, ſubmit to me, put your truſt in me, and I will bleſſe you; if the conſideration of my aptneſſe to be angry in this day, and how dangerous it is to have my wrath kindled but a little, if this will not move you, but you rather (though unworthily and irrationally) count me a hard Maſter; yet, let this prevaile with you, that you ſhall get no leſſe than bleſſedneſſe by truſting in me, yea, none ſhall goe without it, but all they that truſt in me ſhall be bleſſed; yea, and be bleſſed with the higheſt bleſſings, with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heavenly places; yea, with bleſſedneſſe in the abſtract, BLESSED are all they that put their truſt in me; bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe, the Fountaine of bleſſedneſſe ſhall be their Portion: And now come, come and be bleſſed, made really happy; if you will not hearken to this, I have nothing more to ſay, Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him; With theſe words the bleſſed Lamb of God cloſes up his mouth, and goeth about his fathers work.\n\n\nFrom hence we may Obſerve,\n\n1 That although this Decree be concerning the total Amotion of all the Kingdomes of this world, and their being given to the Lord Chriſt, yet, it muſt be declared with abundance of love to the ſoules of men, exhorting all to repentance and ſubmiſſion to the Son, that they may be bleſſed.\n2 That None are exempted (no not the greateſt of ſinners) from the benefit of this Exhortation; For, our Lord directs his ſpeech chiefly and in the firſt place to his greateſt enemies, the Kings and Judges of the earth, that ſet themſelves and take counſell together againſt him and his, Be wiſe O ye Kings, be inſtructed ye Judges of the earth: What encouragement is here to all and the greateſt of ſinners to hearken unto this voyce, and come under his healings, and they ſhall be bleſſed?\n3 We may here behold The abundant riches of free grace, and the immenſe greatneſſe of the love of Chriſt to ſinners; That notwithſtanding the great and unheard of aggravations of the ſins of the Rulers of the world at this day, yet he will have them exhorted and woed to come in unto him, that they may be bleſſed by him; yea further, notwithſtanding this day is a day of great wrath, and the world have ſo provokt him as he cannot find in his heart to intercede for them, although his father in wrath enquire into their actions; yet with what love and grace and ſtrong perſwaſions, doth he exhort men to comeand ſubmit to him that he may bleſſe them? He cannot be contented to ſee the worlds ruines, and the deſtruction of ſoules, before he hath made one Eſſay more, pleading with the world to conſider their preſent and future condition, and accept of him upon his owne Tearmes, that he may give Bleſſedneſſe to them; yea, though the wickedneſſe of this world in this day be ſuch, that it's flint hard, and made ſo by love and mercy, that our Lord is forc't to make a change, alter his voyce, from expreſſions and conſiderations of love, to a threatning of, and pointing to his direfull anger, to try how that may work; yet knowing it's not the naturall tendency of ſuch a voyce to work thorowly upon the hearts of men, his love cloſes with a bleſſed Promiſe of bleſſedneſſe; as he began his work here on earth (in the dayes of his fleſh) with wonderfull unparallel'd expreſſions of love, ſo, will he finiſh his work here with the ſame glory, he concludes with a large Promiſe of rich bleſſedneſſe! How tender is the heart of Chriſt! He ſpeaks but two or three words that have ſymptomes of wrath and diſpleaſure in them, he hides his gracious and loving countenance but a moment, and he can containe no longer, but he muſt unvaile himſelfe and appear in the glory of his Mediatorſhip; It is, as if he had ſaid, I have exhorted you to come and kiſſe me, to ſubmit to me leaſt I be angry, and you periſh from the way, but that hath but little operation upon you, therefore now I diſplay my glory before you; doe but come to me, believe on me, truſt in me, depend and relye upon me onely and alone for happineſſe, forſake all your Idolls, and every thing that is grievous and contrary to me, and I will bleſſe you; doe but truſt me and I will doe it, the father hath given me power to doe it, and by that power I am able to doe it, and my blood ſhall ſpeake the willingneſſe of my heart to doe it, Who ever ſhed his blood for his enemies (ſuch enemies) but I? and if I had not lov'd them with ſuch a love as would give them the greateſt bleſſings, I would never have done it; And not one that doth thus truſt and believe in me ſhall goe without the bleſſing, all they that truſt in me ſhall be bleſſed.\n\n4 That though theſe Kings and Rulers be guilty of moſt abominable wickedneſſe beyond all that ever were before them, ſuch as moves God to ſpeak in wrath to them, yet, There's hope of life and ſalvation for them, if they will hearken to the Goſpel of the Kingdome while it's Preached to them in this Exhortation, and kiſſe the Son before his wrath be kindled but a little.\n5 That in this day of the fathers wrath, Nothing leſſe than a hearty and thorow ſubmiſſion to the Son will pleaſe him, and prevent his wrathbreaking forth to our deſtruction; KISSE the Son leaſt he be angry.\n\n6 It's No Treaſon againſt the Royall Law of King Jeſus, whatever it may be againſt the Lawes of men, to ſeeke to draw men from their obedience to theſe wicked Kings and perverſe Rulers, to kiſſe the Son that they may be bleſſed with his everlaſting bleſſings.\n7 That Men muſt be inſtructed in the wiſedome of God, and be filled with the graces and ſtrength of the ſpirit, before they can be inabled to come under the happy influence of this bleſſed Promiſe, for we ſee, that in order to this ſubmiſſion to the Son, men are exhorted to be filled with wiſedome and inſtruction, to ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling, and then Kiſſe the Son, put your truſt in him, and you ſhall be bleſſed.\n8 That in this day, notwithſtanding the cunning deceits and curious coverings of the Rulers, yet, the Kings and Rulers of the earth, and King Jeſus, are ſo diametrically contrary to each other, in all their wayes and ſtations, as that it is impoſſible for a man to ſerve them, and be a friend to Chriſt; The Exhortation is, Kiſſe the Son, that is, kiſſe none but him, give no obedience but to him, yield ſubjection to none but to him alone, Come out of her my people, come from under obedience to the worlds and Antichriſts Kings, Rulers, and Lawes, and become the ſubjects of Chriſt, ſubmit to the Scepter of the Son; Kiſſe the Son, and then you ſhall be bleſſed.\n9 That this Exhortation with the Decree, is indeed and in truth no other but the Goſpel of the Kingdome, the fore-runner of it; which is Preached to the world immediately before it's brought into the world, to move them to ſubmit to it when it comes, and to call the choſen of God out of the world, to prepare themſelves to meet their Bridegroome.\n10 That this Goſpel of the Kingdome muſt chiefly and in the firſt place be Preached to the Kings, Rulers, and Magiſtrates of the world: Our Lord directs his ſpeech firſt to them, Be wiſe yee Kings, be inſtructed yee Judges of the earth: It muſt be preached to them in particular; it's Preached to the reſt of the world as it were by the by, they are put into the little word all, at the very cloſe of the Exhortation; therefore, how little cauſe will the Kings and Rulers of the world have, to be wroth and angry with the Saints and people of God, for preaching this doctrine to them, although it ſound ſo dreadfully in their eares? You ſee their Authority, they doe but their duty in it, to follow theirLord, and the dictates of his ſpirit, who hath undertaken this work; and they ſhould periſh together with you, if they ſhould hold their peace, and break the Command of their Lord: And their end is onely, that you may be bleſſed if you hearken to it; what a mighty aggravation of your ſin will this be, if you perſecute, oppoſe, and take counſell againſt this doctrine, and the publiſhers of it? The wrath of the Son will be kindled againſt you, and when it's kindled but a little, you periſh from the way preſently, and that inevitably without remedy.\n11 The time of the Preaching this Goſpel, Is the evening of the Goſpels repenting day; The Son of righteouſneſſe is now ſetting apace (as to ſinners) and he will ariſe againe with healings in his wings onely. to thoſe that put their truſt in him; If this voyce be not hearkened to, his wrath will be kindled, and all his enemies ſhall periſh from the way of Bleſſedneſſe; there's no longer day for repentance, they have loſt the bleſſing, and though with Eſau they ſhould ſeek it with teares, they ſhall find no place for it; they ſhall hear this voyce no more, but another, Depart from me yee workers of iniquity, I know you not; after this voyce ceaſes, there remaines nothing but a fearfull looking for of Judgement: Therefore, it highly concernes the whole world, with their Kings and Rulers, to be cautious how they ſtop their eares, againſt this wiſe Charmers charming; ſurely if they doe, what horrors! what terrors! what a maſſie weight of wrath of the Almighty God! what unexpreſſible miſery will be our portion for ever? How unconceivably unſufferably tormenting, all our long day of eternity, will the recounting over all thoſe opportunities (and eſpecially this) we have had, to make our peace with the jealous God, and to get Chriſt to be our friend by an eaſie ſubmiſion to him upon his owne tearms, be? This will be no ſmall Worme gnawing our conſciences to all eternity.\n12 It's worthy our Obſervation, That notwithſtanding thoſe ſymptomes of wrath and diſpleaſure that appear here and there throughout the Exhortation, Yet our Lord will have it end full of grace and love, with a Promiſe full of bleſſedneſſe, Though this Exhortation be made in a day of wrath, and accompanied with wrath, yet, at evening time it ſhall be light, the cloſe of this day ſhall be with a very clear Goſpel demonſtration of the good will of God unto the ſoules of men, ſo that if they hearken not unto him now, they ſhall for ever after hold their peace, be left without the leaſt excuſe, not have a piece of a word to ſay for themſelves, although the wrath of God break forth upon them, periſhing and deſtroying their ſoules with eternall death.\n\n\n", "image_url": "A88385/00005.000.001.left.png", "label": "0"}
